Vice President Mike Pence, who is next in line for the presidency, and his wife tested negative, the White House announced later Friday.

The White House physician said the president and first lady were "both well" at the moment. The New York Times, citing sources, said Trump was showing minor symptoms.

Shortly after Trump's tweet, U.S. stock futures moved sharply lower with Dow futures falling more than 500 points at one point. Dow were down nearly 500 points just ahead of the open Friday.

Trump is now the most powerful figure to come down with Covid-19. Previously, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro had tested positive for coronavirus and survived, as did Britain's Prince Charles.

Trump has come under withering criticism for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, where over 7.2 million have been infected and more than 207,000 people have died, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University.

The president has admitted on tape to knowingly downplaying the severity of the virus and has pushed an overly optimistic outlook on the disease as it spread across the country.

He has aggressively pushed for schools, businesses and sports leagues to reopen after the pandemic hammered the economy, which had been humming along and had given him his strongest argument for reelection. He has also routinely held campaign events where supporters were densely packed together, with many not wearing masks. One prominent person who attended the rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma — Herman Cain — died weeks later from Covid.

During Tuesday's debate against Democrat Joe Biden, Trump said the U.S. is "weeks away" from a coronavirus vaccine.

The announcement came hours after the president said he would begin a quarantine process after top aide Hope Hicks tested positive for coronavirus.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines say people should stay home and quarantine if they might have been exposed to the virus. The agency says people should quarantine for 14 days.

Trump is scheduled to appear at his second presidential debate with Biden on Oct. 15, or 13 days after he revealed his diagnosis. The Commission on Presidential Debates didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on how Trump's diagnosis affects the debates. Trump and Biden are also set to square off Oct. 22.

Hicks is known to spend a lot of time with Trump. The president, first lady and Hicks had traveled Tuesday to Cleveland for the debate on Air Force One with a group that included the president's closest relatives and advisors.

They include White House chief of staff Mark Meadows; national security advisor Robert O'Brien; the president's lawyer, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani; White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany; the president's daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, both of whom are senior White House advisors; the president's sons, Donald Jr. and Eric; Donald Jr's girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle, who previously had Covid; Eric's wife Lara Trump; the president's daughter Tiffany; campaign manager Bill Stepien; top campaign official Jason Miller; White House social media director Dan Scavino; White House counselor Derek Lyons; political advisor Stephen Miller; and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio.

Ivanka Trump and Kushner tested negative Friday morning, according to administration spokeswoman.

Also on that flight was Alice Marie Johnson, a criminal justice reform advocate whom Trump granted clemency for her life sentence for a drug crime.

Trump, 74, rarely wears a mask after months of resistance, and has mocked Biden, 77, for often wearing face coverings.

"I don't wear masks like him. Every time you see him, he's got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away and he shows up with the biggest mask I've ever seen," Trump said about Biden during their debate Tuesday night.

At his age and weight, which is in the range of obesity, Trump is considered to be at high risk of severe illness from Covid-19, according to the CDC's web site. Melania Trump is 50.

Some infected people have been left with lingering health problems, including respiratory ailments.

Biden tweeted Friday morning that he and his wife, Jill Biden, were praying for Trump and the first lady.

The Biden campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the president's diagnosis.

According to NBC News, Hicks had started showing symptoms Wednesday night, when she had accompanied the president and several others to a campaign event in Minnesota. She quarantined on Air Force One on the way back and received positive test results Thursday morning.

Trump briefly visited New Jersey for a fundraising event on Thursday. The president appeared to be lethargic at the event, which was held at his Bedminster golf club, according to the New York Times.

As of Thursday night, Trump had been slated to travel to Florida for a campaign rally Friday night. The White House issued an updated guidance that cleared travel from the president's schedule.

Pence, who is due to take on Sen. Kamala Harris in a vice presidential debate Wednesday, tweeted that he and second lady Karen Pence were praying for the president and the first lady.

Ron Johnson tests positive for COVID-19 (news) <a href="https://www.nbc15.com/2020/10/03/sen-ron-johnson-tests-positive-for-covid-19/"> view original </a> <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'2',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></h2><p id= '2' style="display:none"> MADISON, Wis. (WMTV) - Just days after coming out of a self-quarantine prompted by being exposed to someone with COVID-19, Sen. Ron Johnson has contracted the virus, his office announced Saturday morning.

According to a brief statement, the Wisconsin Republican tested positive on Friday, the same day as announcements came that President Donald Trump, First Lady Melania Trump, several members of the White House staff, and multiple other prominent Republican Senators were all infected.

Johnson is currently asymptomatic and “feel(ing) healthy,” his office explained. He is expected to remain isolated until his doctor gives him clearance to return.

Johnson said he attended a fundraiser Friday night in Ozaukee County before receiving the results of his coronavirus test. He says he wore a mask except for when giving a speech, and stood far away from others at the event. Johnson said he thought it was safe to go to the event because he wasn’t experiencing symptoms, and he was tested out of an abundance of caution.

Johnson had gone into self-isolation on September 14 after learning he was exposed to someone who had tested positive. A test at that time came back negative and returned to Washington on Tuesday, after the isolation period ended.

Since then, he was exposed again, his office recounted, which led to Friday’s test. His office did not state how the senator was exposed this time.

Johnson said in a conference call that he was surprised he tested positive. Having visited the White House, Oval Office and Air Force One, he said routine testing was normal. Since he did not show any symptoms, he did not immediately quarantine after the Friday test.

Full statement from Sen. Ron Johnson:

Senator Johnson was exposed to someone who tested positive for covid-19 on Sept. 14.  He stayed in quarantine for 14 days without developing symptoms and tested negative twice during that time. He returned to Washington on Sept. 29 and shortly after was exposed to an individual who has since tested positive. After learning of this exposure, the senator was tested yesterday afternoon. This test came back positive. Senator Johnson feels healthy and is not experiencing symptoms. He will remain isolated until given the all-clear by his doctor.

Most staff in the senator’s Washington office have been working remotely. The office will go all-virtual for the immediate future.

The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 was intended to give residents more control over their personal information collected online. It limited how companies gather personal data and make money from it and gave consumers the right to know what a company has collected and have it deleted, as well as the right to opt out of the sale of their personal information.

But between the time the law was passed and took effect, major companies have found ways to dodge requirements. Tech and business lobbyists are pressuring the Legislature to water it down further, with proposals to undo parts of the law, says Alastair Mactaggart, a San Francisco real estate developer who spearheaded support for the 2018 law and is behind the effort to amend it.

The measure is supported by Common Sense Media and Consumer Watchdog, along with several privacy experts and labor organizations that say the measure will strengthen the law and protect it from industry attempts to dilute it.

“Overall, it is a step backward for privacy in California,” said Jacob Snow, a technology and civil liberties attorney at the ACLU of Northern California. He argues Proposition 24 would make it easier for businesses to charge customers higher prices — or “pay for privacy” — if they refuse the collection of their data, or downgrade service for those who don’t pay the fee, which could hurt low-income communities and those who can’t pay to protect themselves.

“That’s not how privacy should work. It should not be a luxury that only rich people can afford,” he said.

Mactaggart says these objections are a misrepresentation of the measure and that the “pay for privacy” provision is already part of the existing law.

Proposition 24 would also create the California Privacy Protection Agency, with an annual budget of $10 million, to enforce the law and fine companies for violations.

Now, only the state attorney general can bring enforcement actions, but Attorney General Xavier Becerra has said his office has limited resources and could only bring a handful of cases each year.

It would also triple the fines on companies that violate kids’ privacy or illegally collect and sell their private information, while closing some of the loopholes that proponents say companies such as Facebook, Google and Spotify have exploited by saying they’re not selling personal information but “sharing” it with partners. Consumers could also opt out of data sharing and sales of private information about everything from their race and ethnicity to union membership or religion. <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'3',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></p><h2>President Trump being taken to Walter Reed as a 'precautionary measure' (news) <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/02/president-trump-being-taken-to-walter-reed-military-medical-center-as-a-precautionary-measure.html?__source=androidappshare"> view original </a> <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'4',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></h2><p id= '4' style="display:none"> Trump was seen wearing a mask as he departed the White House shortly after 6:15 p.m. ET and walked toward his helicopter, Marine One. He waved to the press but did not stop for questions.

The move, which appears to mark an escalation in the efforts to treat the president, is being made "as a precautionary measure," a senior administration official told NBC News.

"President Trump remains in good spirts, has mild symptoms, and has been working throughout the day," press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement to reporters at the White House.

"Out of an abundance of caution, and at the recommendation of his physician and medical experts, the President will be working from the presidential offices at Walter Reed for the next few days. President Trump appreciates the outpouring of support for both he and the First Lady," McEnany said.

After his departure from the White House, the president's official Twitter account shared a video of him appearing to speak from the Oval Office.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that he spoke with Trump Friday night.

The president's transfer to the medical facility comes less than a day after he announced his diagnosis. First lady Melania Trump also tested positive for Covid-19.

Earlier Friday afternoon, the White House physician said Trump was "fatigued but in good spirits." The physician, Dr. Sean Conley, also said Trump, 74, had been given an experimental antibody cocktail treatment, and was taking several nutritional supplements as well.

The president announced his diagnosis on Twitter early Friday morning. He has since stayed off the social media platform and out of sight, with White House officials providing few updates about his health throughout the day.

NBC, citing three people familiar with his condition, reported Friday afternoon that Trump has a low-grade fever.

White House communications director Alyssa Farah assured in a statement to NBC on Friday that "the president is in charge" and that power has not been transferred to Pence.

"What we've seen with patients who are older, with Covid, is they can decompensate very quickly and so it could be that they want to have him in a facility that if, God forbid, he does get worse quickly, they can have medical resources available," Gottlieb said.

The charges involve two victims and stem from incidents that occurred more than a decade ago, District Attorney Jackie Lacey said in a statement.

Weinstein, who was convicted earlier this year in New York of sex crimes, now faces a total of four counts each of forcible rape and forcible oral copulation, two counts of sexual battery by restraint and one count of sexual penetration by use of force, involving five victims for crimes that span from 2004 to 2013 in the Los Angeles area, Lacey said.

Representatives for Weinstein, who is serving 23 years in prison in New York, had no immediate comment on the new charges. Weinstein has always denied having nonconsensual sex with anyone.

If convicted as charged in Los Angeles, the once powerful Hollywood mogul faces up to 140 years to life in state prison, according to Friday’s statement.

“I am thankful to the first women who reported these crimes and whose courage have given strength to others to come forward,” Lacey said in a statement.

“The willingness of these latest victims to testify against a powerful man gives us the additional evidence we need to build a compelling criminal case,” she added.

Weinstein, 68, was originally charged in January by Los Angeles prosecutors with sexually assaulting two women during separate incidents in 2013.

His conviction in New York for sexual assault and rape in a criminal case was hailed as a victory for the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct by powerful men.

Prosecutors in Los Angeles have initiated a request for temporary custody of Weinstein from New York. An extradition hearing is set for December.

The city's announcement came after President Donald Trump, who debated Democratic rival Joe Biden on Tuesday in Cleveland, revealed he and his wife have both tested positive for Covid-19 and are in isolation. Trump was transported to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday.

The city's announcement also came shortly after the Cleveland Clinic, which oversaw Covid-19 protocols at the debate, said it's confident that guests at Tuesday night's event were safe from the coronavirus.

"Based on what we know about the virus and the safety measures we had in place, we believe there is low risk of exposure to our guests," the Cleveland Clinic said in a statement.

The city specifically said positive tests were traced to people involved in organizing the debate.

A prominent Ohio lawmaker who attended the debate went into self-isolation on Friday after learning about Trump's positive test.

Ohio House Minority Leader Emilia Strong Sykes said she personally witnessed members of the president's entourage declining masks from health care providers — from the Cleveland Clinic — inside the hall at Case Western Reserve University.

"I am frustrated today as I worry now about my own health and the health of so many others who were present that evening like journalists, support staff, Cleveland Clinic professionals, and many others who could have potentially been exposed," Sykes said in a statement on Friday.

Sykes' communications director, Amber Epling, said her boss texted senior staff that night with her concerns.

"She was just horrified, she was in the same room as them and they just waved off the physicians" offering masks, Epling told NBC News.

The Democrat from Akron, who holds an advanced degree in public health, said she doesn't know how long she'll be in quarantine. She wished Trump and the first lady a speedy recovery.

It wasn't immediately clear how many Case Western or Cleveland Clinic employees were at the site Tuesday night, or if any of them were in close contact with Trump or White House aide Hope Hicks, who tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday.

A spokesman for Case Western also declined comment when asked Friday if the university made any ventilation or filtration system upgrades at the Sheila and Eric Samson Pavilion ahead of Tuesday night's event.

"The university appreciates the additional efforts Cleveland Clinic is taking today for attendees who might have concerns and/or questions," Case Western said in a statement Friday.

Some attendees, who wore masks Tuesday night, said they were livid when maskless spectators strolled into the hall.

Kristin Urquiza, who lost her dad to Covid-19 and was a guest of the Biden campaign on Tuesday, said she was wearing a mask — but was stunned to see no one in Trump's entourage in a facial covering.

U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, said Trump's wife entered the hall just ahead of him but he kept a safe social distance away. But he too was amazed to see so many people without masks at the debate.

"And they walk in without masks, it was really a level of arrogance you rarely see," Ryan told MSNBC.

On Friday evening officers of the Carabineros police force used plumes of teargas and high-pressure water jets to disperse protesters congregating in Plaza Italia, where pockets of violence flared amid a heavy police presence.

Videos show a 16-year-old boy being bundled over the railings of a bridge by a police officer. The boy fell into the dirty concrete channel of the Mapocho river, where he lay motionless, face down in the shallow water.

“As the protesters fled, we saw the moment that the officer intercepted [the boy] and threw him from the bridge,” said Pavel Pavelic Jofre, who led a company of volunteers at the protests.

Addressing the incident in a televised address, General Enrique Monrás, a spokesperson for the Carabineros, did not rule out the force’s responsibility for what had happened, but said that in his opinion, the boy “lost his balance and fell” during an arrest.

He said the force had its own set of videos that absolved it of blame, although he did not say what they showed.

The boy was said to be in a stable condition in the Santa María Clinic, a short distance from where the incident took place.

As images began to filter on to social media, the Carabineros faced renewed pressure to act on a perceived culture of brutality.

Opposition politicians called for General Mario Rozas, the head of the Carabineros, to resign following a string of alleged human rights violations.

Since October last year Chile has been rocked by a wave of mass protests against rampant inequality and a host of systemic injustices. The ensuing police crackdown has been condemned internationally.

Chile’s public prosecutor has said that since last October 8,575 alleged human rights violations have been perpetrated by the Carabineros in the repression of protests, and only 16 police agents have been stood down as a result.

A series of cabinet reshuffles have resulted in three men successively being put in charge of the interior ministry since the demonstrations began, yet the police have retained the support of the government in spite of the numerous allegations against them.

Several international missions, including a delegation sent by the UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, a former president of Chile, delivered damning reports detailing numerous violations that have occurred during the protests, including alleged torture and sexual abuse.

Nonetheless, President Sebastián Piñera used his address before the UN general assembly less than two weeks ago to call for values such as respect for human rights to be strengthened around the world.

Chile’s constitutional referendum will be held on 25 October. In the wake of the latest scandal enveloping the Carabineros, calls went out on social media for further protests to be held over the weekend. <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'11',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></p><h2>New Zealand refuses quarantine-free trips from Australia as Australian Capital Territory joins travel bubble: NZ PM Jacinda Ardern says her country will not open up until Australia records a month without community transmission of Covid-19 (worldnews) <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/oct/03/new-zealand-refuses-quarantine-free-travel-from-australia-as-act-joins-travel-bubble"> view original </a> <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'12',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></h2><p id= '12' style="display:none"> New Zealand will not reciprocate quarantine-free trips across the Tasman as the Australian Capital Territory joins Australia’s travel bubble with the country.

On Friday, Australia’s deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, announced New South Wales and the Northern Territory would allow Kiwis to bypass the compulsory fortnight of quarantine on arrival from 16 October.

On Saturday the ACT joined the scheme.

But on the same day, the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said the country would stand strong on its pledge to not open up until Australia, or specific states and territories, recorded a month without community transmission of Covid-19.

“That’s key for us. One of our criteria is 28 days clear,” she said.

On Saturday, NSW health authorities announced eight consecutive days without a locally transmitted case, making 23 October the next possible day it could fulfil New Zealand’s requirements.

But, it is unlikely Ardern’s government will move on borders that quickly given other requirements, including assurances on border controls, splitting up airports and flights, as well a looming election likely influencing the cautious approach.

In Australia’s embattled state of Victoria, an angry premier Daniel Andrews has slammed hundreds of “selfish” Melbourne beachgoers filmed ignoring social distancing and not wearing masks for jeopardising the state’s progress as it eyes the end of lockdown.

Vision showed beachgoers kissing a news camera and then Seven news reporter Paul Dowsley on the head several times.

“No one has the right to break the rules and potentially put at risk everything that good, decent law-abiding Victorians have created, have built. All of their sacrifice has to be worth something,” Andrews said on Saturday.

Andrews said such behaviour could lead to more community transmission and jeopardise the state’s path out of lockdown.

A number of people were fined on Friday night with police ramping up enforcement over the weekend, patrolling and questioning those on the esplanade and at local eateries.

Victoria recorded another day of single-figure case numbers, with only eight new infections on Saturday, taking Melbourne’s 14-day rolling average to 12.

Three additional deaths brought the state’s toll to 805.

Despite Saturday’s single-figure results, Andrews said a recent outbreak of Covid-19 linked to Australia’s biggest shopping centre showed why it’s unsafe to ease restrictions now.

A cluster of cases at The Butcher Club inside south-east Melbourne’s Chadstone shopping centre had grown to 17 and included a family. The premier challenged Victorians to consider the potential impact of a cluster in such a large, busy setting.

Meanwhile, the Yorta Yorta woman Sheena Watt is set to become Victorian Labor’s first Indigenous parliamentarian, filling the vacancy left by the former health minister Jenny Mikakos. Watt is expected to be announced in the role after a factional party meeting on Sunday.

Further north, NSW health authorities were trying to track down almost 50 people who shared a flight to Sydney with an infected Victorian traveller.

The passenger travelled on Jetstar flight JQ510, which left Melbourne at 11am last Sunday, and tested positive on their second day in quarantine. They are believed to have been infectious while travelling.

NSW Health said there was no ongoing risk to the public and most of the flight’s passengers were already in mandatory hotel quarantine. Authorities were contacting 47 crew and passengers who travelled with special permits or quarantine exemptions.

“Those deemed close contacts of the case have been advised to immediately get tested and isolate for 14 days and stay isolated for the entire period, even if a negative test result is received,” NSW Health said.

NSW’s only case on Saturday was a returned traveller in hotel quarantine, but despite this eight-day streak of zero community transmission, the NSW border with Queensland won’t reopen until 1 November.

Following months of tension between the states, the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said the hard border would lift the day after Queenslanders head to the polls, provided NSW had no mystery cases of Covid-19 in the preceding 28 days.

The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, told reporters she was frustrated to learn the announcement was just a reiteration of the existing policy.

“It is frustrating for me that WA and Queensland keep lumping us in with Victoria,” she said.

Meanwhile, Queensland recorded no new Covid-19 cases, with only six active infections remaining across the state, including five in hospital.

Queenslanders also enjoyed standing in bars while eating and drinking on Friday night for the first time in 10 weeks after restrictions were eased.

The next round of restrictions will ease on 1 November, with the potential opening of the NSW border and 40 people allowed to dance at weddings.

Similar restrictions were relaxed in South Australia with licensed pubs and restaurants allowed to serve drinks to standing patrons, provided they are in an outdoor area from Saturday.

South Australia reported two Covid-19 cases on Friday – the first in more than a week. Both were isolated in hotel quarantine, and were SA’s only active infections.

Western Australia reported one fresh coronavirus case, confirming a positive result from a man who travelled to Perth from Indonesia. The man in his 50s is in hotel quarantine and one of the 20 active cases in the state.

Meanwhile, the premier, Mark McGowan, faced heavy criticism after appearing to use an economic justification for continued border closures.

Asked whether WA would consider a travel bubble with South Australia and the Northern Territory, where case numbers are similarly low, the premier said there was “no benefit” and it would only result in WA losing tourist dollars.

The WA senator and federal finance minister Mathias Cormann on Friday accused McGowan of maintaining closures for the sake of economic protectionism, which he said was “explicitly prohibited in the Australian Constitution”.

McGowan shrugged off the attack, highlighting the federal government’s short-lived intervention in support of businessman Clive Palmer’s legal challenge against WA’s border closures.

“I’m very comfortable our cautious approach has kept the health outcomes good and economic outcomes outstanding within Western Australia,” he said.

WA is the only state with no plans to reopen by Christmas, with McGowan saying he will see how Victoria recovers from the second wave first. <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'12',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></p><h2>Russian Editor Dies After Setting Herself On Fire In Front Of An Interior Ministry Office (worldnews) <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54392005"> view original </a> <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'13',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></h2><p id= '13' style="display:none"> Slavina said on Thursday police had searched her flat looking for materials related to the pro-democracy group Open Russia.

Footage has emerged apparently showing the moment she set herself on fire on a bench in Gorky Street, where the interior ministry in Nizhny Novgorod is situated.

She was one of seven people in Nizhny Novgorod whose homes were searched on Thursday, apparently as part of an inquiry into Open Russia.

Last year, she was fined for "disrespecting authorities" in one of her articles.

"This news was a real blow for me, I knew her," said Natalia Gryaznevich, an aide to exiled Open Russia founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. "I know she was harassed, detained, fined all the time. She was a very active woman," she told BBC Moscow correspondent Sarah Rainsford.

In a Facebook post on Thursday, she said 12 people had forced their way into her family's flat and seized flash drives, her laptop and her daughter's laptop as well as phones belonging to both her and her husband.

The investigative committee insisted that Slavina was only a witness in their case - "and neither a suspect, nor accused, in the investigation of the criminal case", a spokesperson told Ria Novosti.

That criminal case appears to focus on a local businessman who allowed various opposition groups to use his spoof church for forums and other activities including training election monitors. Mikhail Iosilevich created the so-called Flying Spaghetti Monster church in 2016 whose followers were dubbed Pastafarians.

Ms Gryaznevich told the BBC that Open Russia had taken part in a "Free People" forum in April 2019 in Nizhny Novgorod which Irina Slavinia had attended as a journalist. Neither the man being investigated nor Slavina herself were part of Open Russia, she stressed.

She said the journalist had been fined 5,000 roubles (Â£50) because of her coverage of the event. The authorities had decided that the event she covered was connected to an "undesirable organisation", according to Ms Gryaznevich.

A swathe of tougher media and internet laws have recently come into force in Russia amid concern they may be used by the government to silence its critics.

The Kremlin said at the time the legislation was needed to improve cyber security. <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'13',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></p><h2>Coronavirus vaccination to be given for free in Japan (worldnews) <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/10/02/national/coronavirus-vaccination-given-free-japan/"> view original </a> <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'16',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></h2><p id= '16' style="display:none"> Members of the public in Japan will be given a dose of vaccine against the novel coronavirus for free, according to a health ministry policy approved Friday by its advisory panel, in a bid to curb serious and fatal cases of infection.

The policy addresses the first dose for everyone amid uncertainty at this stage over how many times a vaccine would need to be administered.

Whether the policy will cover foreign residents in Japan has yet to be officially determined, a ministry official said, while offering his personal opinion that it would be natural to include them for the sake of public health.

The government is trying to secure enough vaccines by the first half of 2021 to administer to all members of the public, having earmarked a budget of ¥671.4 billion ($6.4 billion).

It has agreed with British drugmaker AstraZeneca PLC and U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. to receive 120 million doses of vaccine from each company when successfully developed, and is also negotiating with U.S. firm Moderna Inc. for 40 million doses or more.

In case a vaccination causes serious side effects, the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry plans to have the state, not companies, redress patients and pay damages through a law revision at an extraordinary Diet session expected to start later this month, it said.

“I am convinced that there will be no longer any way around sanctions,” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told t-online in an interview Saturday.

Germany currently serves as the president of the EU, a rotating position for the 27-member bloc. Leaders are expected to announce their response to the poisoning, which is believed to have been ordered by Moscow, at their next summit starting on Oct. 15.

Navalny, considered the unofficial leader of the Russian opposition and a top critic of President Vladimir PutinVladimir Vladimirovich PutinThe world according to Putin Murphy: Russia will become more of a threat to US election while Trump is in quarantine Fracking ban: Bad for America, bad for Americans, but what to do?

After initially barring him from leaving the country, the Kremlin succumbed to international pressure and allowed him to travel to Berlin, where he is receiving treatment.

He has since been released from the hospital.

Navalny was poisoned with the nerve agent Novichok, which had been used previously in an attempted assassination of an ex-Russian spy in the United Kingdom. That attack is also believed to have been ordered by Moscow.

The poisoning of Navalny drew condemnation across the West, including from several lawmakers in Washington.

Germany has faced pressure to scrap an agreement on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which brings gas from Russia to Germany.

“So many European workers would suffer from a construction freeze,” Maas said.

But have you ever wondered how much your dog really loves you?

In a new study by Canine Cottages, four different pups were fitted with special heart rate tracking collars to show what gets them excited when interacting with their owners.

Combining the heart rate tracking data from the four dogs over seven days, their average heart rate was 67 beats per minute.

But when the dogs were told “I love you” by their owners, their heart rates rocketed up to 98 beats per minute.

The findings also revealed that cuddling can calm a dog’s heart rate - and let’s be honest, we humans love it too.

According to the results, the dogs’ heart rates decreased by 23 per cent on average when they were being cuddled by their humans.

But that’s not all - the study also highlighted the ways your dog can express their love for you.

Jared Polis plans to mass-pardon 2,732 convictions of low-level marijuana possession through an executive order Thursday after signing a bill earlier this year that gave him that authority.

“This really catches Coloradans up with where the law is today,” he told The Denver Post.

House Bill 1424, passed by the General Assembly earlier this year, included a provision that allows the governor to pardon those who have convictions on their criminal records for possessing up to 2 ounces of marijuana — the current legal limit for medical marijuana users.

Polis’ pardon, however, will only apply to convictions in state courts through 2012 of up to 1 ounce for recreational use, consistent with Colorado Amendment 64, passed by voters in 2012.

It will not apply to convictions in municipal courts or in other states.

The governor said his office worked with the Colorado Bureau of Investigation to sort through criminal histories and determine the exact number of eligible convictions. The total number of individuals who will benefit from the pardon was not immediately available because a single person could have been convicted on more than one charge.

Unlike programs in Denver and Boulder to expunge marijuana convictions, those eligible for the pardon will not have to apply. In the first six months of Denver’s program, fewer than 1% of the 13,000 people eligible successfully got their convictions erased.

Other states have taken action to address previous low-level convictions after marijuana legalization. Nevada, for instance, automatically pardoned more than 15,000, and California has adopted an automatic expungement process for certain marijuana convictions.

Minor marijuana offenses could stand in the way of people obtaining jobs, student loans or concealed-carry permits, Polis said.

“In addition to being symbolic, (the pardon) has real-life ramifications for people,” he said.

Anyone who wants to check if Polis’ pardon will apply to them can go to comarijuanapardons.com.

The pardon won’t expunge or seal records related to the convictions, according to the governor’s office. But the convictions will be removed from individuals’ public records, so if a member of the public runs a background check, a conviction won’t show up. It would still appear in law enforcement background checks but with a note about the governor’s pardon.

That’s the next goal for Rep. James Coleman, a Denver Democrat and one of the sponsors of House Bill 1424.

“Whether it’s one or a thousand (people), my focus is to figure out by the time I’m done in the legislature how we not only pardon these individuals but figure out how to expunge it off their records,” Coleman said.

He plans to look at more policies in the 2021 legislative session to address equity and opportunities for people to work in the cannabis industry. <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'21',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></p><h2>Humpback whales seize chance to sing in Alaska's cruise-free Covid summer (upliftingnews) <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/02/humpback-whales-sing-alaska-covid-summer-researchers"> view original </a> <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'23',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></h2><p id= '23' style="display:none"> For Alaskans, summertime means cruise ships. Lots of cruise ships. The 2020 season was expected to commence with a record-breaking deluge of 1.4 million tourists and glacier gazers  that would effectively triple the state’s scant population of 730,000. Once the pandemic hit, that number effectively dropped to zero.

Yet although the economy is being decimated by the reduction in tourist vessels, the state’s humpback whales are some of the few locals actually enjoying the silence. Dr Michelle Fournet, director of the Sound Science Research Collective and research fellow at Cornell University, has been listening in on whale conversations for 10 years, but never before has she seen a summer like this.

“It’s the first time in human history that we’ve had the technological ability to listen to these whales in a meaningful way without us interfering … it’s a really, really big deal.

Most whale watching in Alaska happens out of Juneau’s Auke Bay, and it’s one of the most popular excursions for those visiting on a cruise ship. More than one-quarter of all passengers opt for this day tour, which amounts to over 350,000 travelers packing the boats each year, according to Suzie Teerlink, marine mammal specialist with Noaa Fisheries. On a busy day, there can be 10 or more whale-watching vessels clustering around a single whale or group, prompting concerns about vessel overcrowding.

With as many as 65 whale-watching boats zooming around Juneau and nearby Glacier Bay national park on any given day during the summer, humpbacks change their behavior in two distinct ways: they call louder and they call less.

Researchers are also gathering blubber biopsies to analyze the animals’ stress hormones during the 2020 season. They obtain the samples by firing an untethered biopsy dart or bolt from a modified .22 rifle or crossbow – researchers argue that this causes only limited harm - and compare the cortisol levels against samples collected from the same whales in 2014. <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'23',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></p><h2>The era of greyhound racing in the U.S. is coming to an end (upliftingnews) <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2020/09/greyhound-racing-decline-united-states/?s=09"> view original </a> <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'24',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></h2><p id= '24' style="display:none"> Eight greyhounds thunder around the sandy oval at Derby Lane in St. Petersburg, Fla., the oldest continuously operating dog track in the U.S. Florida voters chose to effectively ban dog racing in the state by the end of 2020, which will wipe out nearly the entire American greyhound racing industry.

Itâs 8:30 on a Saturday night in August. A gibbous moon hangs low in the Florida sky, its pale glow no competition for the red neon proclaiming, âGREYHOUND RACINGâ and âDERBY LANE.â About 300 people are scattered around grandstands that once held thousands, murmuring among themselves while the loudspeaker plays big band and rockabilly tunes.

They fall silent when itâs time for Frederick Davis to lead the parade of dogs.

Next, Davis, 41, and the eight handlers he supervises will put the dogs in the starterâs box. The mechanical rabbit named âHare-son Hareâ will zoom past, squeaking and shooting blue sparks. The doors will fly open, and the greyhounds will burst onto the track, their bodies a blur, their paws tossing sand in the air as they gallop around the oval for 30 seconds. They hit speeds of up to 45 miles per hour, making them second only to the cheetah, the fastest land animal on Earth.

In its glory days of the 1950s, Derby Lane attracted thousands of avid racing fans, such as Joe DiMaggio, who left Marilyn Monroe sitting in the car while he ran inside to place his bets. Now only a few hundred show up for the races, a sign of how its fan base has dwindled.

Famed sports columnist Ring Lardner called Derby Lane âthe Churchill Downs of greyhound racing.â When the dogs run, you can still get a hint of its glory days. This was once a place that seemed full of glamour and excitement. The stands would be packed with men and women in suits and hats. Babe Ruth and Sophie Tucker were frequent visitors. Joe DiMaggio once left Marilyn Monroe in an idling car chatting with the valet while he ran inside to place his bets.

Derby Lane is the oldest continuously operating greyhound racetrack in the United States, but itâs headed on its last stretch. Two years ago, Florida had more greyhound tracks than any other stateâ11 out of 17 nationwide. Now itâs down to three, with about 1,700 dogs still racing.

In 2018, Floridaâs voters had the chance to approve a constitutional amendmentâAmendment 13âthat would ban betting on greyhounds as of December 31, 2020. The proposal, which effectively bans greyhound racing, was brought by critics of the sport who contend dog racing is cruel and inhumane.

The racing industry bet on beating the amendment, arguing that its supporters were exaggerating stories of dogsâ mistreatment. The industry spent just a fraction of what supporters did on the campaign, believing the sport was popular enough that the majority of Floridians wouldnât vote to ban it.

Greyhounds stretch their legs at Farmer Racing. Though generally gentle and non-aggressive, greyhounds often wear muzzles around each other because they can get competitive, having been trained to race after the same lure. They also have very thin skin and little body fat, so even playful nips can cause serious injuries.

They misjudged. Nearly 70 percent of voters said yes to the shutdown. Now the tracks must close by New Yearâs. Derby Laneâs final race will be December 27.

Davis, a tall, slender man with dreadlocks and a quick smile, will be one of 400 Derby Lane employees out of work. He isnât sure what heâll do next. Heâs been at the track for 14 years and considers this his ideal job.

He might try to become a security guard, he says. That way he could work with dogs againâguard dogs, though, not greyhounds.

Heâs not the only Derby Lane employee wondering about the future.

âItâs a shame to have to shut down after 95 years,â says Derby Lane CEO Richard Winning, 64, whose office overlooks the track. His family has owned Derby Lane since it opened in 1925. He predicts that once the Florida tracks close, the ones in other states will follow.

âIn 20 years, will anyone even remember what greyhound racing was?â he asks.

This is the one thing on which he agrees with Carey Theil, whose Massachusetts-based greyhound advocacy group, Grey2K USA, spearheaded the drive for Amendment 13: Once Floridaâs tracks are gone, so too is the whole industry.

âFlorida really was the industry,â Theil says.

Winning is a born storyteller, with a droll manner, a gray beard, and a trio of cigars tucked in the pocket of his teal fishing shirt. He started out at the track 45 years ago collecting 50-cent pieces from the turnstiles, and since then he has worked almost every other job. He remembers when the regulars included rakish gamblers called âThe Flickerâ and âChampagne Tony,â the track restaurant served a 37-ounce prime rib, and a live bandânot recordingsâplayed between races.

Winning says greyhounds are the only breed of dog mentioned in the Bible, which is sort of true. The King James version of Proverbs 30:31 includes them in a list of things which are âcomely in going.â (Scholars say the original Hebrew refers to Afghans or Salukis).

Dog collars hang above a tub filled with raw beef and rice as kennel owner and trainer John Farmer prepares to feed some 60 dogs. In total, they eat about 90 pounds of beef mixed with commercial dry dog food, water, electrolytes, rice or macaroni, multivitamins, and supplements to combat anemia.

Farmer rubs down his dog Rick Swift Creek with a muscle-soothing liniment. He also checks his dogs for ticks, looks at their nails, and massages their muscles. The dogs spend their days either waiting for the 30 seconds theyâre racing or recovering afterward.

In the 18th century, an eccentric English nobleman obsessed with coursing created the modern English greyhound through selective breeding, according to Cynthia A. Braniganâs The Reign of the Greyhound. With lean, aerodynamic bodies, long legs, and shock-absorbing foot pads, greyhounds were built for speed. They have a proportionally bigger heart than other breeds, and more red blood cells and hemoglobin, which carry more oxygen to their limbs. Their sprinting gait (a âdouble suspension rotary gallopâ) and high proportion of fast-twitch muscles power short, quick bursts of speed.

But dog racing as we know it today originated with an American inventor named Owen P. Smith who ironically wanted to be kind to animals. To him, the dying rabbits sounded like a child screaming.

âNobody in the history of any sport brought about a change comparable to that worked by the inventor of the device, and yet no inventor in sports history is so little known,â Sports Illustrated commented in 1973.

Smith did more than invent a humane lure. He and two partners designed the first modern greyhound track, which opened in 1919 outside Oakland, California. It failed, as did several others they opened. The tracks flopped because they didnât allow betting. Gambling, while popular, was illegal.

The first commercially successful track was one Smith and his partners opened in 1921 in a swampy South Florida area known as âHumbuggus,â later to become the city of Hialeah. It was so close to the Everglades that the track owners hired a snake-catcher to intercept stray reptiles. Five thousand people turned out for the first race, watching a dog named Old Rosebud take the $60 purse, according to Going to the Dogs: Greyhound Racing, Animal Activism, and American Popular Culture, by Gwyneth Anne Thayer.

The key to its success: Electric lights. Running races at night meant working people could attend. With Floridaâs 1920s land boom in full roar, thousands of new residents sought evening entertainment. The track ran until 1926, when a hurricane demolished it. New owners converted it to horse racing.

Flamenco Dancer, also called Bunny, was one of Farmerâs champion racing dogs. Between 2017 and her retirement in 2020, Bunny earned more than $83,000 in purses, of which Farmer got a percentage. Most racing dogs retire at about five years old, when they start to slow with age.

In 1925, on the other side of the state, Derby Lane opened under a cloud. The partners who built it ran out of money and couldnât pay what they owed for the real estate or the lumber. Thatâs how T.L Weaver, Winningâs great-grandfather, took possession of the venue. He grew beans in the infield, says track historian Louise Weaver, and between regular races had monkeys in uniform ride the dogs as if they were jockeys, their outfits sewn onto the greyhoundsâ blankets so they couldnât jump off.

Although betting was illegal, tracks in the 1920s âdid something sneaky,â Winning said. âThey sold shares in the dogs.â The winners would get their money back plus a âdividend.â Losers would fail to recoup their âinvestment.â Other tracks skipped the subterfuge and ran âon the fixââthey bribed local lawmen.

In 1931, with the Depression bankrupting local governments, Florida legislators floated a bill to legalize wagering on dog and horse races and tax it. Governor Doyle Carlton, a Bible-thumping Baptist, opposed the bill. Thirty years later he contended, âinterested parties were buying their way through the legislatureâ and claimed gamblers offered him $100,000 to sign the bill. He vetoed it instead. State senators overrode his veto, making Florida the first state to legalize betting on horse and dog races.

Once that law passed, racing took off. New greyhound tracks popped up across the state, from Tampa (1932) to Orlando and Jacksonville (1935) to Pensacola (1947) to Key West (1953).

Greyhound racing became part of Floridaâs sun-and-fun image. Mickey Mantle filmed a cigarette commercial at Derby Lane. Boxing champs and movie stars hung out at the tracks. The 1959 movie A Hole in the Head shows Frank Sinatra and Keenan Wynn betting on races at Miamiâs Flagler Kennel Club.

Susan Butchko, who has been fostering and adopting greyhounds since 1999, pets her newest adopted dog, a retired racing greyhound named Remy. Often described as â45-mile-per-hour couch potatoes,â greyhounds make good pets, owners say.

At Dippelâs Florida home, retired racing greyhound Roxanne walks through the shallow end of the swimming pool.

Florida tends to be a sunny place full of shady people. The money involved in dog racing attracted plenty of them. Winning recalls seeing Tampa mob boss Santo Trafficante, Jr., laying down bets at Derby Lane. Some mobsters were more than customers. Lucky Luciano and Meyer Lansky had an interest in South Florida dog tracks, according to Scott Deitche, author of seven books on the Mafia.

A state racing commission was supposed to keep out unsavory elements. But in 1950, Senator Estes Kefauverâs Special Committee to Investigate Organized Crime reported that mobsters controlled the commission and made illegal campaign contributions to politicians, including then Governor Fuller Warren.

The mobâs involvement sparked frequent rumors about fixed races where dogs were overfed before the race to slow them down, or their toes cinched up with rubber bands to alter their ability to run, or they were drugged to make them faster or slower.

Dog-doping has continued to be a problem, particularly with the use of cocaine, which can grant a short-term burst of speed. In 2017, state racing officials revoked a trainerâs license because five of his greyhounds running at Derby Lane had tested positive for cocaine. Months later a trainer at a North Florida track was also suspended after a dozen of his dogs tested positive. In the three years since then, state officials say, 10 more trainers have had dogs test positive for cocaine.

The use of performance-enhancing drugs is just one of greyhound racing opponentsâ concerns about the industry. Grey2K, which has spent nearly 20 years compiling reports on the welfare of racing greyhounds, says that even standard industry practices amount to mistreatment. When the dogs arenât racing, for example, theyâre often confined to small cages in warehouses. Dogs are forced to race under conditions that can cause serious injuries, too, they say. Grey2Kâs website has collected documented cases of greyhounds that have broken their legs and backs, fractured their skulls and spines, and even gotten electrocuted by the lure.

The Florida Greyhound Association, an industry group, did not respond to requests for comment.

The larger concern is what happens to them when theyâre not racing.

In 1952, the Greyhound Racing Record said only 30 percent of greyhounds bred for racing would become competitors, leaving open the fate of the other 70 percent. Even those that do race only do so until theyâre about five years old. Grey2K has compiled all the news stories over the years about greyhounds being destroyed or sold to laboratories for experimentation.

Among their evidence of cruelty: a 2010 case from a track in the Florida Panhandle town of Ebro, where a trainer left 37 dogs to starve to death after the racing season ended. He ended up pleading guilty to more than 30 counts of animal cruelty and being sentenced to five years in prison.

Possibly the worst case happened in 2002. A security guard for the Pensacola track was arrested after authorities found an Alabama junkyard where, over 10 years, he had killed and buried some 3,000 greyhounds. He said heâd been paid $10 each for shooting them when they got too old. A prosecutor called the junkyard âDachau for dogs.â The guard died before he could be brought to trial on animal cruelty charges.

The scandals cut down greyhound racingâs popularity as fans were turned off by the repeated reports of mistreatment. Meanwhile, competing gambling operationsâfirst the Seminole and Miccosukee Tribesâ casinos, then the Florida Lotteryâbegan siphoning off the profits, Winning said.

The loyal fans tended to skew older. In 2001, when Steven Soderbergh filmed a scene at Derby Lane of George Clooney and Brad Pitt recruiting someone for their Oceans 11 robbery, their target was Carl Reiner, then 79. He fit in perfectly with the graying greyhound crowd.

Photos of the finish line help Derby Lane judges determine which dogs finished in which place.

âYoung people donât like to have to handicapâ the dogsâ chances, Winning grumbles, referring to the way ardent bettors carefully examine each dog and its record. âThey just want to stare at their phonesâ and not put the time in.

Now the typical race fan is Jim Wickert, 77, a retired golf course owner who shows up at Derby Lane every Wednesday and Saturday sporting his jaunty tan Orvis fedora. A Derby Lane regular since 2003, he enjoys handicapping the dogsâ chances.

âI like trying to figure them out,â he said. âI donât bet big, but itâs still exciting when you do figure things out and they run the way you think they should.â He said he once won $10,000 on a race.

Heâs not sure where heâll go once the track closes. Nothing else seems as exciting.

When Winning looks back at Floridaâs racing heyday, in the 1980s, he remembers Keefer, the dog that won the Distance Classic in 1986. Some 12,779 people turned out that day to watch this superstar runâthe largest crowd in track history. Now a Saturday crowd at Derby Lane might number 700 tops, Winning says.

in live race profits.

*The Iowa Greyhound Park was known as the Dubuque Greyhound Park before 2015.

Over the past 10 years, the money brought in by live greyhound racing has dropped from $117 million to less than $40 million a year, state figures show. At Derby Lane alone, it dropped from about $12 million to $3.2 million in 2019.

The industry tried to adapt, winning legislative approval in 1997 to add poker rooms and simulcasting, which allows bettors at one venue to wager on races at another. Now the poker rooms are packed with younger customers, and the simulcasting has its fans too. Those will go on after dog racing ends, Winning says. But it wasnât enough to save Floridaâs racetracks.

For a decade, Grey2K tried to persuade Florida legislators to ban greyhound racing, to no avail, Theil says.

Finally, they appealed to the stateâs Constitutional Revision Commission, which meets every decade to update the constitution. A Tampa area state senator named Tom LeeâWinning calls him âour idiot legislatorââproposed Amendment 13. The amendment technically bans betting on live dog races, but by extension, it essentially bans the races themselves. Without betting, there is no profit, and the tracks canât afford to stay open.

Grey2K and its allies, such as the Humane Society of the United States, spent $3 million convincing voters to pass it, Theil says. They spent almost all of it running graphic TV ads showing injured racing dogs.

The Florida Greyhound Association fought back with ads that asserted that Grey2K was exaggerating its stories of injuries and death, as well as warning that the amendment was full of âtrickerationâ that would somehow lead to bans on hunting and fishing. Its yard signs implied that banning racing would also ban greyhounds.

But the association couldnât get support beyond its declining fan base. Thayer, author of Going to the Dogs, says the track owners, kennel owners, and dog trainers had been too fractured among their individual interests for too long to present a unified front.

Nearly 70 percent of the voters said yes to the amendment. Winning and others in the industry insisted the voters were confused somehow. A lawsuit to overturn the vote went nowhere.

The impending shutdown makes the future of more than 8,000 dogs associated with the Florida tracks uncertain. Greyhound adoption agencies are trying to find them homes, although not all the agencies are allowed to help. Those that supported the ban are not welcomed by track owners. Only adoption agencies that opposed the amendment can get dogs.

Track veterinarian Donald Beck and trainer Kelsie Gubbels care for BD Wells, who has a minor ligament injury. When he's healed, heâll go to GST Sun State Adoption to find his forever family.

One of those is Tampa resident Sharon Dippelâs GST Sunstate Greyhound Adoption. She and her husband, Brian, have adopted eight former racing greyhounds themselves. They go through a couple of 44-pound bags of dog food every 10 days or so, she says.

So far, Dippel says, plenty of people have lined up to adopt the soon-to-be-unemployed dogs. She says it helps that the tracks are not all shutting down at once. Some closed shortly after the 2018 vote, while others closed in early 2020 because of the coronavirus.

Theyâre not high-strung animals, says longtime Derby Lane veterinarian Donald Beck. Theyâre affectionate. In his years of working at Derby Lane, heâs never been bittenâbut he has been scratched a few times by excited dogs jumping on him.

Plenty of people got into the racing business because of their affection for greyhounds. Trainer and kennel owner John Farmer, a Klamath Tribe member from Oregon, fell in love with the breed when he was 11 and his mother let him watch races at Multnomah Greyhound Park. Heâs now 55, with so many mementoes of his winning dogs that he carries them in an overflowing Tupperware container.

Grey2K is working to convince those states to join Florida in outlawing the industry, just as itâs going after the other countries where it remains legal: Australia, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam.

Farmer remains hopeful that he can use his Native American heritage as a way to save racing in Florida. Heâs got a plan to convince either the Seminole or the Miccosukee tribes to acquire a track that would operate in conjunction with one of their casinos and thus be exempt from state or federal regulation. That would, he said, âbuild a tradition.â So far, though, the tribes have expressed no interest.

Gubbels, the youngest trainer at Derby Lane, visits the Davis Island Dog Beach in Tampa with her partner Kenan Culesker, daughter Emma, and their retired racing greyhound Flying Amity. Theyâre part of a Facebook group called Beach Bound Hounds, which tries to convene retired greyhounds and their owners once a week at the dog beach.

"All my life lessons really come from the game of lacrosse. Playing in those medicine games, those traditional medicine games and using a traditional wooden stick," Thompson tells NPR's Morning Edition.

The Games' organizers recognized their mistake, but the roster of eight teams was full.

Enter: Ireland. Its team was set to play in 2022.

"None of us would be going to Birmingham, Ala., in the first place if it wasn't for the Iroquois and giving us the gift of their medicine game," Sonny Campbell, a player for Ireland Lacrosse, tells Morning Edition.

He says the Irish team wanted to do more than make a statement.

So earlier this month, it dropped out of the tournament, allowing the Nationals to take its spot.

"We support them, and if it means we'll give up our spot, then so be it. But the Iroquois, they need to be there," Campbell says.

Thompson says the move was unexpected.

"A sense of me felt bad because they're sort of sacrificing and giving up their opportunity. But a part of me felt like this is the right move, and I do truly believe that," he says.

Thompson says Ireland's sacrifice won't be in vain.

"The Iroquois Nationals are going to put together the best team the world has ever seen, and representing not just the Iroquois Nationals, but Ireland lacrosse also," Thompson says.

"Good Morning America," revealed the surprise today to students attending five public school districts located in Allegheny Valley, Pennsylvania, Jackson, Mississippi, Baltimore, Maryland, Santa Fe, New Mexico and South Bend, Indiana. They will now have five years of free internet connection in their homes, thanks to T-Mobile's Project 10Million--a program that aims to eventually get free Wi-Fi to 10 million students' households in the US.

Of the 50 million children learning remotely, between 15 and 16 million lack adequate internet connectivity, according to the Center for Democracy and Technology. As a result, many students have turned to fast food restaurants or school parking lots to access online classes.

In Jackson, where school administrators are dealing with the challenges of online learning, Errick Greene, Superintendent of Jackson Public Schools told “Good Morning America” that about 25 percent of students are not connected through the internet.

The digital divide has been present even before the pandemic hit, with many households without internet access due to racial, economic and geographic inequalities.

"There’s a lot of barriers, infrastructure barriers, cost barriers and just barriers in general to getting people connected," said Brett Slezak, Supervisor of Technology at Allegheny Valley School in Pennsylvania.

In Baltimore, 20,000 families were without access to broadband, which is equivalent to 40,000 students.

And in indigenous communities in New Mexico, 40 percent of students do not have internet access.

"We had some families that might go to town to go to a Starbucks or McDonald's to use Wi-Fi said Kimball Sekaquaptewa, chief technology director at the Santa Fe Indian School.

"They did what they needed to do, but that is just unacceptable in our community," said Sekaquaptewa.

"To keep our tradition strong is to continue to learn our language. And without Internet access, I don't think we'll have the privilege of that," added Marcelina Smith, a member of the Jemez Nation.

Now, as many students have begun the school year across the country, school districts are working hard to close the gap.

In South Bend, where public schools have deployed buses with Wi-Fi to neighborhoods that needed it most, T-Mobile has gifted hot spots with free data for five years through its initiative, Project 10Million, which delivers reliable internet connectivity for free to students who don’t have access to it.

School administrators or parents interested in receiving free hotspots and data for students in their school district can learn more on T-Mobile's website.

In addition, Donors Choose is helping educators receive school supplies during these challenging times.

While it’s been challenging for families across the country during the pandemic, educators and communities all over the country aren’t giving up.

"While there’s great needs, there’s also great sense of soul and heart and care that this community has and demonstrates daily as they help us to ensure that all of our scholars have their basic needs met," said Greene. <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'26',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></p><h2>France's environment minister announced a gradual ban on using wild animals in traveling circuses, on keeping dolphins &amp; killer whales in captivity in marine parks &amp; on raising mink on fur farms. starting immediately, France’s marine parks won’t be able to bring in or breed dolphins &amp; killer whales (upliftingnews) <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/france-ban-wild-animals-circuses-marine-parks-73307384"> view original </a> <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'27',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></h2><p id= '27' style="display:none"> PARIS -- France's environment minister has announced a gradual ban on using wild animals in traveling circuses, on keeping dolphins and killer whales in captivity in marine parks and on raising mink on fur farms.

Pompili said the measures will also bring an end to mink farming, where animals are raised for their fur, within the next five years.

The ban does not apply to wild animals in other permanent shows and in zoos.

Editor's Note: This story has been updated to reflect that Sen. Ron Johnson was still awaiting the results of his COVID-19 test when he attended the Oktoberfest. He says he got the result that he was positive afterward.

“I feel fine, I feel completely normal,” he said in a conference call with reporters, adding that he didn’t “stick around” to mingle at the dinner.

Attendees paid from $40 for a single ticket to $500 for “gold host” status, which included two meal tickets, priority seating, and “special host recognition.” Former Wisconsin attorney general Brad Schimel was the evening’s featured guest, according to an invitation on the Ozaukee County Republican Party’s Facebook page.

Johnson has previously come out against statewide mask mandates, and warned against “overreacting.” We “don’t shut down our economy because tens of thousands of people die on the highways,” he said in March.

News of Johnson’s diagnosis comes as Wisconsin’s COVID-19 cases and deaths have risen to record levels. President Donald Trump tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday, and is now being treated at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. His doctors insisted the president was in good condition on Saturday and had not been given supplemental oxygen—a claim soon undercut by White House chief of staff Mark Meadows.

First lady Melania Trump also tested positive for COVID-19, but claims to have only “mild symptoms.” Multiple Trump insiders who were in close proximity to the president in recent days have since tested positive, including senior White House counselor Hope Hicks, former senior White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, Trump 2020 campaign manager Bill Stepien, and former New Jersey governor Chris Christie.

Johnson was the third GOP senator to test positive for COVID-19 in 24 hours, after Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT) and Thom Thillis (R-NC). He believes he caught the virus from his chief of staff, Tony Blando, who recently recovered from his own COVID infection. Johnson himself quarantined for 14 days after Blando tested positive, ending his stay in isolation just days before his own positive result.

On Saturday, the Trump campaign held several events across the country, some of them indoors and many of them mask-free. <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'31',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></p><h2>Biden campaign says it will now disclose the result of every coronavirus test (politics) <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-campaign-says-it-will-now-disclose-the-result-of-every-coronavirus-test/2020/10/03/c4fdc30c-058f-11eb-b7ed-141dd88560ea_story.html"> view original </a> <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'33',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></h2><p id= '33' style="display:none"> Joe Biden’s campaign said Saturday it will now disclose the result of every coronavirus test the candidate takes, following increased pressure for more transparency after President Trump recently tested positive for the virus and Vice President Pence has released results for two consecutive days.

Bates did not say how often Biden would be undergoing such tests, beyond saying they would happen on a regular basis. Biden, who tested negative Friday, told reporters he had not undergone a test Saturday but would on Sunday.

Biden’s approach has come under increased scrutiny now that Trump has been hospitalized. Unlike Trump, the former vice president  has made a point of abiding by the recommendations of public health officials, although he has continued his travel despite his proximity to Trump on the debate stage last Tuesday.

Biden’s campaign has scrapped a partially indoor event and suspended negative ads since Trump’s diagnosis, while the candidate himself took the unusual step of wearing a mask throughout an entire speech and, on Saturday, declined to criticize the president during a town hall event with transit workers.

With Election Day now a month away, the campaign is trying to figure out how to approach an unprecedented situation with the 74-year-old incumbent hospitalized and the 77-year-old challenger himself at risk.

“I really don’t think that anybody knows how it changes the dynamics yet,” said Rep. Cedric L. Richmond (D-La.), Biden’s campaign co-chairman.

Richmond did predict that Biden’s message will shift to focus less on Trump and more on Biden’s plans should he win. “I think you stick more to policy,” he said, noting that Biden has already put the need for better management of the pandemic at the center of his pitch.

On Saturday, Biden was initially reluctant to criticize Trump during a virtual event with members of the Amalgamated Transit Union when he was asked how he would handle the coronavirus pandemic differently.

But Biden went on to ridicule Trump for not providing enough personal protective equipment to workers most at risk of catching the coronavirus.

Trump’s prognosis remains uncertain, and it may be difficult for the Biden camp to formulate a longer-term strategy until it becomes clear how serious the president’s condition is. An ill president tends to evoke empathy and concern, though Trump’s situation is more complicated because he so openly flouted health recommendations and expressed contempt for those who did follow the rules, including Biden.

Instead of focusing on his critique of Trump, Biden has reiterated his commitment to mask-wearing, an implicit rebuke to the president’s reluctance to wear a face covering.

Biden wore a mask for an entire 20-minute speech Friday, a departure from his normal practice of wearing a mask as he walks to a lectern and then removing it when he delivers an address.

Biden’s team decided to go ahead with a planned campaign trip Friday to Grand Rapids, Mich., although he had been exposed to Trump three days earlier at the debate. The decision was made on the advice of doctors who, among other factors, thought he had not been close enough to Trump or his entourage during the debate to merit self-isolation.

Other Democrats are taking a different approach. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) announced Saturday that he plans to self-quarantine for two weeks after sitting near Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who recently tested positive, during a hearing. “I’ll keep doing my job, fighting for Michiganders, by working virtually from home,” he said.

Debate moderator Chris Wallace, who was seated farther from Trump, has said he was in a “uniquely vulnerable circle” because he was on the debate stage. Wallace said his physician recommended that he wait until Monday to take a test, since “it takes five days for the virus to load up enough and I could have a test today and it’d be a false negative.” Wallace has self-quarantined since the debate.

Richmond said the developments underscore the importance of enforcing the health rules at the debates, adding that he does not know whether there will be another Trump-Biden debate. Two more are scheduled.

He referred to the ongoing discussions between the presidential campaigns and the Commission on Presidential Debates, the independent body that oversees the four matchups. Biden’s team has pushed for Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) and Vice President Pence to be farther apart on the stage.

Also, before Trump’s diagnosis was revealed, Biden’s team had offered suggestions to add more structure to the debates, including the possibility of a mute button.

Biden aides say they’re expecting the vice-presidential debate to go forward as planned Wednesday.

They also stressed that they don’t expect any major overhaul to Biden’s schedule, which includes trips in the coming days to Arizona and Florida.

Democrats Joe Biden and Sen. Kamala D. Harris hold a steady lead over President Trump and Vice President Pence, with an edge of 53 percent to 43 percent among registered voters, according to the latest Post-ABC News poll. Biden also leads Trump in the key battleground of Pennsylvania.

Active bilingualism is an important predictor of delay in the onset of symptoms of mild cognitive impairment. (science) <a href="https://www.uoc.edu/portal/en/news/actualitat/2020/360-bilingualism-alzheimer.html"> view original </a> <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'41',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></h2><p id= '41' style="display:none"> 
	As well as allowing us to communicate with other people, languages are the tool we use to convey our thoughts, identity, knowledge, and the way we see and understand the world. Mastering more than one language enriches us, provides a gateway to other cultures and, according to a team of researchers led by scientists from the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) and Pompeu Fabra University (UPF), actively using them also brings us neurological benefits and protects us from cognitive impairment associated with ageing.


	In a paper published in Neuropsychologia, the researchers conclude that speaking two languages on a regular basis – and having done so all one's life – enhances cognitive reserve and delays the appearance of symptoms associated with cognitive decline and dementia.


	"The prevalence of dementia in countries where more than one language is spoken is 50% lower than in those regions where the population uses only one language to communicate," said researcher Marco Calabria, professor at the UOC Faculty of Health Sciences and member of the University's Cognitive NeuroLab research group and the  Speech Production and Bilingualism research group, at the UPF.


	Previous work had already found that the lifelong use of two or more languages could be a key factor in increasing cognitive reserve and delaying the onset of dementia, as well as offering advantages for memory and executive functions.


	"We wanted to discover the mechanism through which bilingualism contributes to cognitive reserve in cases of mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's, and whether there were differences in terms of the benefit gained from different degrees of bilingualism, and not only between monolingual and bilingual people," said Calabria, who led the study.


	Therefore, unlike in previous studies, the researchers established a bilingualism gradient: from people who speak only one language but are passively exposed to another, to individuals who have excellent proficiency in both and use them indiscriminately on a day-to-day basis. To create this gradient, several variables were taken into account, including the age of acquisition of the second language, the use made of each language, and switching between languages in the same context.


	The researchers focused on the population of Barcelona, where the use of Catalan and Spanish is highly variable, with some predominantly Catalan-speaking neighbourhoods and others where Spanish is the main language. "We wanted to take advantage of this variability, and instead of comparing monolingual and bilingual people, we looked at whether in Barcelona – where everyone is more or less bilingual – there was a certain degree of bilingualism that had neuroprotective benefits," explained Calabria.


	They recruited 63 healthy individuals, 135 patients with mild cognitive impairment such as memory loss, and 68 people with Alzheimer's – the most prevalent type of dementia – in four hospitals in Barcelona and the metropolitan area. They used a questionnaire to establish proficiency in Catalan and Spanish and ascertain each person's degree of bilingualism. They then correlated this degree with the age of neurological diagnosis and the onset of symptoms.


	To better understand the origin of cognitive advantage, they asked participants to perform various cognition tasks, focusing primarily on the executive control system, as previous studies have suggested that this is the source of the benefit. In total, the participants performed five tasks in two sessions, such as memory tests and cognitive control.


	"We saw that the people with a higher degree of bilingualism received a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment later than those who were passive bilinguals," said Calabria, who surely considers speaking two languages and regularly switching from one to the other to be lifelong training for the brain. According to this researcher, such linguistic gymnastics is related to other cognitive functions, such as executive control, which kicks in when we perform several actions at once, for example when we drive, to help us filter out relevant information.


The brain's executive control system is related to the system used to control two languages: it has to switch between them, making the brain focus on one and then the other, to avoid one language intruding into the other when we speak.


	Calabria considers that "in the context of neurodegenerative diseases, this system could offset symptoms. So, when something is not functioning well due to the disease, thanks to the fact that it is bilingual, the brain has efficient alternative systems for resolving the problem," also stressing that "we have seen that the more you use both languages and the better your language skills, the more neuroprotective advantage you have. In fact, active bilingualism is an important predictor of delay in the onset of symptoms of mild cognitive impairment – a preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease – because it contributes to cognitive reserve".


	Now researchers want to see whether bilingualism is also beneficial for other diseases, such as Parkinson's and Huntington's disease.

The researchers used these tweets as a proxy for the President’s sleep duration. On a typical day, the President starts tweeting at around 6am. He continues to tweet about once every two to three hours throughout day, with an average of 10 tweets per day.

But, although President Trump still consistently wakes up at around 6am, the frequency of his Twitter activity between 11pm and 2am has increased 317% since 2017.

During the early days of his presidency, President Trump typically posted late-night tweets on average one evening per week. But by April of 2020, that had increased to about three nights per week.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that adults over age 65 sleep 7-8 hours per night. But on the three nights per week that the President tweets late at night, his average tweet time is 12:06 am.

This suggests, the researchers write, that when the President stays up late, he’s getting fewer than 6 hours of sleep per night, on average.

The study, titled “Later bedtimes predict President Trump’s performance,” found that this increase in late-night activity cannot be accounted for by the President’s travel schedule, nor by an increase in his overall tweeting activity.

Those wee-hour tweets are hurting his performance. The study finds that on the day following one of his late nights, the President’s Twitter followers interact less with his tweets: he gets 7,400 fewer likes per tweet, 1,300 fewer retweets, and 1,400 fewer replies, which figures equate to 6.5% – 8% fewer than average. As the researchers put it, after a late night he posts fewer “home run” tweets and more “non-resonant” ones.

Despite the President being happy in 88% of the transcripts, his late-tweeting nights and more late tweets appear to make him less happy the following day. The proportion of “happy” transcripts following a late night decreases almost 5%. Likewise, the proportion of angry transcripts increases by about 3% after a late night.

Although this shift in President Trump’s tweets has not yet attracted much attention in the media, the betting markets have certainly taken notice. After one of President Trump’s late nights, the odds of his leading opponent winning the 2020 election consistently increased by 0.6%, based on data provided by odds-tracker BetData.

The authors say their study is the first they know of to use this data to argue that President Trump’s sleep duration has become noticeably shorter. “The pattern we document is consistent with a progressive shortening of the President’s sleep over his first term and compromised performance from sleep deprivation,” they write. <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'42',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></p><h2>Floridians who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 were less likely than those who voted for Hillary Clinton to have evacuated before Hurricane Irma made landfall, according to a new study that examined GPS location data from more than 2.7 million U.S. smartphone users (science) <a href="https://www.psypost.org/2020/10/trump-voters-were-significantly-less-likely-to-evacuate-before-hurricane-irma-devastated-florida-58144"> view original </a> <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'44',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></h2><p id= '44' style="display:none"> Floridians who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 were less likely than those who voted for Hillary Clinton to have evacuated before Hurricane Irma made landfall, according to a new study that examined GPS location data from more than 2.7 million U.S. smartphone users. The research was published in the journal Science Advances.

As Hurricane Irma approached Florida in 2017, conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh questioned the severity of the category 5 storm, suggesting that media outlets were trying to create “fear and panic” to push a “climate change agenda.” Shortly afterward, conservative pundit Ann Coulter also expressed skepticism about the severity of Hurricane Irma.

The authors of the new research were interested in whether this widely-reported hurricane skepticism had impacted actual evacuation behavior.

“We had followed much of the news around hurricanes in 2017 with Harvey and Irma and had initially been interested in examining evacuation disparities using widescale smartphone data. Until now, most studies had relied on surveys with small samples or questionnaires about a hypothetical hurricane,” said study author Elisa Long, an associate professor at the UCLA Anderson School of Management.

By statistically analyzing anonymized smartphone location data, county-level hurricane alerts, the 2010 U.S. Census, and precinct-level results for the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the researchers were able to find that political partisanship was associated with differences in evacuation behavior among Florida residents in 2017.

In the 10% of Florida precincts with the highest share of Trump voters, fewer than 29% of residents evacuated during Irma, as opposed to more than 40% in the 10% of precincts with the highest share of Clinton voters. The divide in evacuation behavior was found both in counties that received an official hurricane warning and in counties that received no such alert.

“Hurricanes and other natural disasters used to be largely non-political, but in recent years, there is both a growing mistrust of government-issued warnings, compounded by climate change skepticism. After conservative media outlets widely espoused some ‘hurricane conspiracy’ theories just before Irma, we see a wide gap (about 10-11%) emerge in the likelihood of evacuating an oncoming hurricane. This difference was not found during Harvey or Matthew,” Long told PsyPost.

This was true even after the researchers controlled for sociodemographic variables and even geographic factors such as distance to the coast and elevation above sea level.

“One possible explanation is: Maybe Democrats just tend to live near the coast or in flood-prone areas, and that’s why they evacuated at higher rates? To test this, we include very fine geographic controls (called a geohash-7) that are independent of any political or geographic boundary,” Long explained.

But the study — like all research — includes some limitations.

“Because we use smartphone location data, we of course cannot include everyone in our sample, particularly more vulnerable individuals like nursing home residents. But given that about 80% of Americans own a smartphone, we are able to include over 1 million people in our Florida sample,” Long said.

“We are also hoping that our general methodology on using smartphone data to track movements before, during, and after natural disasters, like hurricanes, could help first responders and relief workers target their message accordingly, and help with response efforts,” Long added.

Global energy consumption in 2050 could be reduced to the levels of the 1960s and still provide a decent standard of living for a population three times larger, according to a new study. (science) <a href="http://www.leeds.ac.uk/news/article/4679/decent_living_for_all_does_not_have_to_cost_the_earth"> view original </a> <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'45',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></h2><p id= '45' style="display:none"> Global energy consumption in 2050 could be reduced to the levels of the 1960s and still provide a decent standard of living for a population three times larger, according to a new study.

The study, led by the University, has estimated the energy resource
needed for everyone to be provided decent living standards in 2050 – meaning
all their basic human needs such as shelter, mobility, food and hygiene are
met, while also having access to modern, high quality healthcare, education and
information technology. 
The findings, published in in the journal Global Environmental Change, reveal that
decent living standards could be provided to the entire global population of 10
billion that is expected to be reached by 2050, for less than 40% of today’s
global energy. This is roughly 25% of that forecast by the International Energy
Agency if current trends continue. 
This level of global energy consumption is roughly the same as that during
the 1960s, when the population was only three billion. 
The authors emphasise that achieving this would require sweeping changes in
current consumption, widespread deployment of advanced technologies, and the
elimination of mass global inequalities. 
However, not only do the findings show that the energy required to provide a
decent living could likely be met entirely by clean sources, but it also offers
a firm rebuttal to reactive claims that reducing global consumption to
sustainable levels requires an end to modern comforts and a ‘return to the dark
ages’. 
The authors’ tongue in cheek response to the critique that sweeping energy
reform would require us all to become ‘cave dwellers’ was: “Yes, perhaps, but
these are rather luxurious caves with highly-efficient facilities for cooking,
storing food and washing clothes; comfortable temperatures maintained
throughout the year, computer networks — among other things — not to mention
the larger caves providing universal healthcare and education to all 5-19 year
olds.” 

“Our study is consistent with the long-standing arguments that the technological solutions already exist to support reducing energy consumption to a sustainable level.”   Dr Joel Millward-Hopkins, School of Earth and Environment

The study calculated minimum final energy requirements, both direct and
indirect, to provide decent living standards. Final energy is that delivered to
the consumer's door, for example, heating, electricity or the petrol that goes
into a car, rather than the energy embedded in fuels themselves – much of which
is lost at power stations in the case of fossil fuels.
The team built a final energy-model, which builds upon a list of basic
material needs that underpin human well-being previously developed by Narasimha
Rao and Jihoon Min. 
The study compared current final energy consumption across 119 countries to
the estimates of final energy needed for decent living and found the vast
majority of countries are living in significant surplus. In countries that are
today’s highest per-capita consumers, energy cuts of nearly 95% are possible
while still providing decent living standards to all.

“It is clearly within our grasp to provide a decent life for everyone while still protecting our climate and ecosystems.”   Professor Julia Steinberger, leader of the Living Well Within Limits project at Leeds

Study lead author Dr Joel Millward-Hopkins from the School of Earth and
Environment at Leeds said: “Currently, only 17% of global final energy
consumption is from non-fossil fuel sources. But that is nearly 50% of what we
estimate is needed to provide a decent standard of living for all in 2050.” 
“Overall, our study is consistent with the long-standing arguments that the
technological solutions already exist to support reducing energy consumption to
a sustainable level. What we add is that the material sacrifices needed to for
these reductions are far smaller than many popular narratives imply.” 
Study co-author Professor Julia Steinberger leader of the Living Well Within Limits project at the
University Leeds and professor at the Université de Lausanne in Switzerland
said: “While government official are levelling charges that environmental
activists ‘threaten our way of life’ it is worth re-examining what that way of
life should entail. There has been a tendency to simplify the idea of a good
life into the notion that more is better. 
“It is clearly within our grasp to provide a decent life for everyone while
still protecting our climate and ecosystems.” 
Study co-author Professor Narasimha Rao from Yale University said: “This
study also confirms our earlier findings at a global scale that eradicating
poverty is not an impediment to climate stabilization, rather it’s the pursuit
of unmitigated affluence across the world.” 
Study co-author Yannick Oswald, PhD researcher at the School of Earth and
Environment at Leeds said: “To avoid ecological collapse, it is clear that
drastic and challenging societal transformations must occur at all levels, from
the individual to institutional, and from supply through to demand.”

If the entire sheet went away, it would add 24 feet to global sea levels.

Greenland is on track to lose more ice this century than it has at any other point in the Holocene, the 12,000-year period in which human civilization has flourished, an alarming new study has found.

The study, published today in the journal Nature, offers the latest evidence that Earthâs northernmost ice sheet, which contains enough frozen water to raise global sea levels by 24 feet, has entered a period of rapid decline and may melt away entirely if humanity continues burning fossil fuels at current levels. The research also puts to rest the notion that Greenlandâs recent deterioration might be part of a natural cycle, by showing just how fast the current meltdown is compared with the ups and downs of the geologic past.

âWe have confidence now that this century is going to be unique in the context of natural variability of the last 12,000 years,â says lead study author Jason Briner, a glaciologist at the University at Buffalo.

Over the last 40 years, rapid Arctic warming has caused Greenland to lose ice at an accelerating clip. But in order to place this trend in a long-term context, scientists require records of the ice sheetâs growth and decline over thousands of years.

Previously, researchers had attempted to reconstruct changes in the size of Greenlandâs ice sheet throughout the Holocene using oxygen-18 isotopes inside ice cores, which give an indication of past temperatures. But most of those analyses extrapolated climate conditions across all of Greenland from a single ice core, adding significant uncertainty to the reconstruction. And no prior studies had stitched together model reconstructions of Greenlandâs history with projections of how much ice will melt this century.

Briner and his colleagues have now filled this gap in time, and in the process they have reconstructed Greenlandâs melt history in a more sophisticated way. The researchers combined an ice sheet model with both temperature and snowfall data from a series of ice cores collected across Greenland. They then extended this information across the ice sheet using a climate model. The researchers ran their models backward and forward in time, from 12,000 years ago to A.D. 2100, using low- and high-carbon emissions scenarios to game out possible futures for the ice sheet.

Their results show that Greenlandâs present-day meltdown is as extreme as anything that has ever occurred during the Holocene.

Between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, a warming event known as the Holocene thermal maximum caused Greenlandâs ice sheet to shrink dramatically. During one particularly extreme century, approximately 6,000 billion tons of ice meltedâcomparable to the 6,100 billion tons of ice Greenland could lose this century if the average melt rate from 2000 and 2018 is extrapolated forward in time.

But 6,100 billion tons is a conservative estimate of how much ice Greenland is on track to lose: As carbon continues to accumulate in the atmosphere, the planet will continue warming and average melt rates should continue to speed up. Itâs also likely that Greenland will experience more extreme melt years like 2012 and 2019, when heat waves on top of climate change conspired to trigger enormous summertime ice losses.

Under an optimistic scenario where humanity quickly reduces global carbon emissions, Brinerâs models show that Greenland will lose about 9,700 billion tons of ice this century. But if we continue to burn fossil fuels with abandon, Greenland could lose closer to 21,000 billion tons of ice this century, a melt rate approximately four times higher than the highest model estimates for the past 12,000 years.

That latter scenario, called RPC 8.5, is considered pessimistic from an emissions standpoint, but it is the pathway Greenland is following most closely based on recent ice losses. The RPC 8.5 findings are also consistent with another recent study that concluded Greenland could be ice free in as few as 1,000 years.

âThe paper is also an answer to those who dismiss the ongoing effects of climate change with âthe earth has always changedââand the answer is, ânot at this paceâ,â Scambos says.

The studyâs results come with an important caveat: The authors restricted their models to southwest Greenland because the region has relatively simple physics, with most of the ice melt driven by air temperatures as opposed to ocean warming and the breakup of glaciers that spill into the sea. From there, they extrapolated across Greenland.

The ice losses the researchers concluded from their models closely matched observational data from the last 40 years, lending support to the findings. Still, as a next step, the team would like to apply their models across all of Greenland and incorporate additional processes that melt and break up ice.

Southwest Greenland is âthe region that has showed one of the highest increases in melting in recent years, so itâs a good indicator for how the rest of the ice sheet will likely change overall,â says glaciologist Ruth Mottram of the Danish Meteorological Institute, who wasnât involved in the paper.

Mottram points out that the authors also used glacial morainesâfields of rocky debris left behind after a glacier retreatsâto see how well their models of ice growth and decline matched real-world evidence. âThe combination of field and model results helps us to have more confidence in the model results for the past climate and hopefully therefore in the future projections,â she says.

âAlthough the authors point out that trends in modern mass loss are similar for this region and the ice sheet in its entirety, it is possible that this correlation would not hold over much longer time periods when the ice sheet's geometry was different from present,â Enderlin says.

While thereâs more work to be done to suss out the finer details of Greenlandâs past and its future fate, Scambos says at this point the scientific community has amassed enough evidence to say with confidence that Greenlandâlike Earthâs climate at largeâwill be dramatically altered unless humanity changes course. <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'46',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></p><h2>Passengers from the Ruby Princess cruise ship may have infected up to 11 people with COVID-19 on a single domestic flight between Sydney and Perth in March.

The findings, based on genomic sequencing by West Australian researchers, has prompted Qantas to step up its demands for a consistent national protocol for sharing of passenger manifests.

On March 19, QF577 left Sydney for Perth with 243 passengers, 60 of whom had been passengers on cruise ships, including 28 from the Ruby Princess, 30 from the Ovation of the Seas and at least two from the Sun Princess.

Eleven of the cruise ship passengers were later found to have been infectious while on board QF577, including one "super spreader".

Tests showed they had a particular strain of the virus that developed on the Ruby Princess.

"Among these, eight cases were classified as flight associated," the study found.

"These eight persons did not know each other. Four had commenced their journeys from different US cities and had taken an overnight flight from Los Angeles, California, USA, which landed at Sydney Airport on the morning of March 19.

All up, 64 of QF577's 243 passengers experienced an illness consistent with COVID-19, 29 of whom tested positive for the virus, including 13 who had been on the Ruby Princess and four from the Ovation of the Seas.

No cabin crew tested positive for COVID-19 following the flight.

The Ruby Princess disaster has been linked to more than 660 infections and at least 28 deaths.

A Special Inquiry into the disaster found NSW Health made inexcusable and inexplicable mistakes that saw 2,700 people given permission to disembark on March 19 when some passengers were displaying flu-like symptoms.

As previously reported by the ABC, Qantas and Virgin Airlines were repeatedly denied access to the Ruby Princess passenger manifest, told by Border Force and health authorities that such information could not be released for privacy reasons.

Qantas said it did not become aware cruise ship passengers were on QF577 until two days after the flight.

Domestic and international chief executive for Qantas Andrew David said the airline wanted a "consistency of approach" on the sharing of manifests between state and federal authorities.

Qantas medical director Dr Ian Hosegood said that if the airline had known of the COVID risk, cruise ship passengers would not have been allowed to board.

UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — Can’t stop checking social media for the latest COVID-19 health information? You might want to take a break, according to researchers at Penn State and Jinan University who discovered that excessive use of social media for COVID-19 health information is related to both depression and secondary trauma.

The study, which published online on Aug. 15 in the journal Computers in Human Behavior, included 320 participants living in urban districts of Wuhan, China. In February 2020, the team gave the participants an online survey that investigated how they accessed and shared health information with family members, friends and colleagues on social media, specifically WeChat, China’s most popular social media mobile app.

The team used an instrument created to measure Facebook addiction to assess participants’ use of WeChat. Using a 5-point Likert-type scale, ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree, the survey assessed participants’ views of WeChat in providing them with informational, emotional and peer support. The survey also assessed participants’ health behavior changes as a result of using social media.

“We found that the Wuhan residents obtained tremendous informational and peer support but slightly less emotional support when they accessed and shared health information about COVID-on WeChat,” said Zhong. “The participants also reported a series of health behavior changes, such as increased hand washing and use of face masks.

More than half of the respondents reported some level of depression, with nearly 20% of them suffering moderate or severe depression. Among the respondents who reported secondary trauma, the majority reported a low (80%) level of trauma, while fewer reported moderate (13%) and high (7%) levels of trauma. None of the participants reported having any depressive or traumatic disorders before the survey was conducted.

It is the first time such a figure has been calculated. Of these people, 40% had neither cough nor fever.

The study, published in PLOS Medicine and led by Professor Rachel Batterham (UCL Centre for Obesity Research, Division of Medicine and UCLH) found that participants with loss of smell were 3 times more likely to have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies compared with those with loss of taste.

The study was funded by the NIHR UCLH Biomedical Research Centre, where Prof Batterham is Obesity Theme Director.

It has been known for some time that Covid-19 can cause loss or reduced ability to smell (anosmia) or taste, without cough or fever. Existing data suggest a prevalence of smell and/or taste loss in the range of 31-85% in Covid-19 patients.

For this study, researchers looked at a group of people in the community with loss or smell and/or taste, to see how many had antibodies. Since a high proportion of this group had antibodies, this suggests smell and/or taste loss is highly predictive of a COVID-19 infection.

Although self-isolation and testing on the basis of smell or taste loss alone is recommended in the UK, at a global level few countries recognise loss of smell and/or taste as symptoms and advise testing and self-isolation. The majority are focused on fever and respiratory symptoms. Researchers said this must change in order to reduce the spread of the pandemic.

Recruitment to the study took place between 23 April and 14 May 2020 by sending text messages to people registered with a number of primary care centres in London who had a new loss in their sense of smell and/or taste. A total of 590 participants enrolled via a web-based platform and responded to questions about loss of smell and taste and other COVID-19–related symptoms.

Of these, 567 then had a telemedicine consultation with a healthcare professional who confirmed the history of their symptoms and supervised a test to find out if they had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

A total of 77.6% of 567 people with smell and/or taste loss had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; ofthese, 39.8% had neither cough nor fever, and participants with loss of smell were 3 timesmore to have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, compared with those with loss of taste.

New loss of smell was more prevalent in participants with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, compared with those without antibodies (93.4% versus 78.7%).

Professor Batterham said: “As we approach a second wave of infections, early recognition of COVID-19 symptoms by the public together with rapid self-isolation and testing will be of vital importance to limit disease spread.

“Acute loss of sense of smell needs to be considered globally as a criterion of self-isolation, testing, and contact tracing.

The share of millennials who say college was worth their student loans dropped 10 points from March 2019, to 46%.

A new series from Morning Consult takes a deeper look at how the coronavirus pandemic could permanently alter millennials’ behavior and how, in turn, that could impact the economy at large. The data is drawn from a poll of 4,400 adults, including 1,287 millennials.

Since the economic standstill brought by pandemic-related shutdowns, the unemployment rate has shot up to 8.4 percent and initial jobless claims rose to 870,000 for the week ending Sept. 19. And the relief to consumers offered earlier in the pandemic in the form of enhanced unemployment benefits and stimulus payments looks unlikely to re-emerge, with talks in Congress over another economic stimulus package indefinitely stalled.

Among all adults who have taken out student loans, the trend was similar, although not as pronounced. Fifty-four percent said that their student loans were worth their college education in the September 2020 survey, a 7-point drop from the 61 percent who said the same in 2019.

Millennials in both surveys were the least-likely generation to look back on their student debt and college degrees favorably. Compared to millennials at 46 percent, 51 percent of Gen Xers and 67 percent of baby boomers said taking out student loans was worth attending college.

There are now about 10,000 apartments for sale in Manhattan, which would be a record, according to Compass. With so many new listings pouring onto the market and so few buyers, the inventory of unsold apartments continues to rise in a city that already had a glut of high-end apartments before the pandemic. The current supply of luxury apartments for sale would take nearly three years to sell, according to a report from Miller Samuel and Douglas Elliman.

"There is no shortage of apartments for sale, but there is a shortage of buyers," said Jonathan Miller, CEO of Miller Samuel.

There were a total of 1,375 sales in the third quarter, down 44% from a year earlier. The prospects for a turnaround before the election also look increasingly unlikely. Signed contracts for September fell 42% in Manhattan from last year, according to Miller Samuel.

Manhattan is looking at high unemployment, rising crime, growing sanitation and public transit problems, and only 10% of office workers in Manhattan are returning to their buildings. All this makes buyers reluctant to make a big bet on Manhattan real estate.

The likelihood of rising taxes to pay for the city's and state's multibillion-dollar budget holes is also driving more and more of the city's real estate dollars to the suburbs and other states. Signed contracts in the Hamptons were up 76% in September compared with last year. They increased 56% in Westchester County, New York, and 36% in Fairfield County, Connecticut.

Florida has seen a nonstop surge in buying, with signed contracts for homes in Palm Beach County up 62% and up 21% in Miami-Dade County.

Yet the average sale price in Manhattan rose 32% in the third quarter to $2.18 million. The median sales price also increased by 7% to $1.1 million.

Analysts say the increase was mainly due to statistical flukes. Activity in the third quarter of 2019 was depressed by the launch of the city's mansion tax. Also, a spate of hyper-priced deal closings at the new luxury condo tower 220 Central Park South, which were negotiated years ago, also raised prices.

Analysts also say the average and median sales prices in Manhattan are more a reflection of which apartments are selling versus a way to gauge the value of the same apartment over time. Because the third quarter saw more sales of larger, more expensive apartments, the average and median prices skewed higher.

A more accurate reflection of price drops, they say, is the average discount between the asking price and sale price. Apartments in the third quarter sold for an average discount of 9% — compared with a more typical discount of 5% before the coronavirus pandemic.

"If you look at 2009 and then Sept. 11, the sellers can take a few years to adjust," Miller said.

Miller said he doesn't expect true prices to fall more than about 10%. Before the pandemic, prices were already down 15% from the peak of 2015-2016, he said. So the combined discount of 25% off the peak should be enough to attract buyers to the city again, he said. <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'52',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></p><h2>American, United move ahead with more than 32,000 furloughs, but will recall workers if coronavirus aid deal reached (economics) <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/30/american-airlines-moves-ahead-with-19000-furloughs-but-will-recall-workers-if-cornoavirus-aid-deal-reached.html"> view original </a> <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'55',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></h2><p id= '55' style="display:none"> American Airlines and United Airlines will start furloughing more than 32,000 employees on Thursday after talks for a national coronavirus aid package failed in Washington, but both carriers say they are prepared to reverse course if a stimulus deal is reached.

Airlines spent the last several months urging lawmakers for another $25 billion in payroll support, a proposal that has won bipartisan support. That would have preserved jobs through the end of March, despite weak travel demand.

However, talks for a broad coronavirus package that would include another round of airline aid faltered on Wednesday, opening the door to more than 30,000 job cuts, starting Thursday, the lion's share of them at American and United.

Executives have said they don't expect demand to bounce back to 2019 levels without a coronavirus vaccine and have said the pandemic's resulting crisis for the industry is worse than after the Sept. 11 attacks.

Losses topped $10 billion in the second quarter alone and a public hesitant about travel promises more difficult months ahead. Airlines have slashed service to match weak demand as the pandemic and a web of travel restrictions hurt bookings, particularly for once-lucrative international routes.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to reach a deal earlier Wednesday, but talks are set to continue.

Parker told employees he spoke with Mnuchin late Wednesday and told him that if further talks yield a deal, American would "reverse" the furloughs and recall workers.

It was not immediately clear how long that offer would stand, but PSA Airlines, a regional carrier American owns, told pilots that if Washington doesn't approve another stimulus package by Oct. 4 "the furloughs will still occur," according to a company memo seen by CNBC.

United will cut more than 13,000 jobs. "We implore our elected leaders to reach a compromise, get a deal done now, and save jobs," United said in a message to staff.

Flight attendants make up the bulk of United's reductions with 6,939 set to be furloughed.

"Tomorrow, tens of thousands of essential aviation workers will wake up without a job or healthcare and tens of thousands more will be without a paycheck," Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, the country's largest flight attendant union, said in a statement.

Nelson, who led efforts to get the first and attempts at the second aid package passed with airline support included, urged lawmakers and the Trump administration to reach a deal.

Airlines aren't just shedding workers through forced cuts. Tens of thousands of employees have accepted buyouts and temporary leaves of absence, lowering airlines' labor bills.

United for example, more than halved the number of furloughs it expected, which stood at about 36,000 this summer, through early retirement packages, voluntary schedule reductions and leave options, and a deal with its pilots to reduce guaranteed minimum pay. <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'55',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></p><h2>Some Public Companies Took Out PPP Loans Then Paid Dividends And Bought Back Shares (economics) <a href="https://www.ibtimes.com/some-public-companies-took-out-ppp-loans-then-paid-dividends-bought-back-shares-3051995"> view original </a> <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'56',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></h2><p id= '56' style="display:none"> Some publicly traded companies that received loans under the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act, or PPP, subsequently bought shares of their own stock and paid out dividends, raising questions about whether such loans were even needed by some firms.

The Washington Post reported that while the practice is not prohibited, the taxpayer-backed, low-interest forgivable small business loans were mostly designed to pay employees during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the rules of the Small Business Administration, PPP loans could also be used to pay mortgage interest, leases or utility bills. (PPP rules did not specifically ban loan recipients from paying investors as long as they were paid from separate funds).

Still, some large financially viable companies were able to access the loans that were meant for small firms with less than 500 workers.

For example CRH Medical Corp. (CRHM), a Canadian-based medical supply company with American subsidiaries, received a $2.9 million PPP loan in mid-April to support 124 U.S. employees.

“Given the economic uncertainties that CRH and the healthcare industry were facing in March and April when CRH’s loan was applied for and used, these funds were necessary to support the ongoing operations of CRH, to retain or rehire its employees as contemplated by the loan program,” a company spokesman told the Post.

However, since that time CRH has made five acquisitions and bought back almost $230,000 of its shares in the second quarter.

The CRH spokesman said the stock repurchases were a previously planned automatic stock buyback that had been postponed in the early weeks of the pandemic.

Another company, RCI Hospitality Holdings (RICK), which operates nightclubs and adult entertainment centers, received a $4.2 million PPP loan. But it has since paid out $273,000 in dividends.

Some lawyers and advocacy groups complain that companies that can afford to shell out millions of dollars in dividends and stock buybacks should not have been allowed access to any PPP loans in the first place.

Concerns about undeserving companies – including well-heeled publicly traded firms – receiving PPP loans had arisen as early as April. At that time the SBA said that companies with access to other funding sources were “unlikely” to qualify for PPP loans. Some firms returned the money, but some did not.

Franklin Turner, a government contracts attorney at McCarter & English, a Washington D.C.-based law firm, told the Post that stock buybacks and dividends “would certainly be something that any government regulator would likely consider” in future loan programs.

“The requirement was not that companies be flat broke when they apply … the requirement was ‘can you make a reasonable good faith determination that you need this [money],’” Turner added.

Back in July, advocacy groups and government watchdogs raised questions about the issuance of PPP loans and urged that future loan programs have increased transparency. <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'56',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></p><h2>It’s time for states that grew rich from oil, gas and coal to figure out what’s next (economics) <a href="https://theconversation.com/its-time-for-states-that-grew-rich-from-oil-gas-and-coal-to-figure-out-whats-next-145295"> view original </a> <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'57',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></h2><p id= '57' style="display:none"> The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.

Fossil fuels enrich producing states through multiple revenue streams. They include taxes and royalties tied to the value of production; sales taxes on hydrocarbons; use taxes on equipment; and income taxes on industry employees’ wages.

Texas earns the most of any state from energy production, generating US$16.3 billion in fiscal year 2019, which was 7% of the state’s revenue. The states that are most reliant on energy are Alaska, where it accounted for 70% of state revenues ($1.1 billion) in fiscal 2019; Wyoming, where energy and other minerals yielded 52% of state revenues ($2.2 billion) in FY2017; and North Dakota, which reaped 45% of its revenues ($1.6 billion) from energy production in fiscal 2017.

Meanwhile, studies show that Wyoming residents receive from the state up to 10 times the value in services that they pay in taxes, thanks largely to fossil fuel-related taxes. These trends clearly can’t continue in parallel: As coal revenues fall, state spending will have to contract.

There are several examples of successful just transition programs. One is Project QUEST in San Antonio, which highlights the benefits of “local contextualization” and has helped workers transition from manufacturing to health care, information technology and other trades.

The province of Alberta, Canada, achieved considerable buy-in from labor unions and electricity companies as it accelerated its retirement of coal power, in part by leveraging its natural gas resources and working with local labor unions. And the New Economy program, promoted by the nonprofit organization Appalachian Voices, is amplifying residents’ ideas for new economic initiatives to offset job losses and shrinking coal tax revenues. This kind of participatory approach to economic diversification is critical for securing community support and generating novel ideas for economic development.

Alaska, Texas, New Mexico, Wyoming and North Dakota also have substantial sovereign wealth funds – state-owned accounts, funded with revenues from natural resource extraction. These funds could help fill the gap, but only if politicians can withstand pressure to use the money in more popular ways, such as Alaska’s annual payouts to state residents from oil revenues.

The choices that states make as they navigate a rapidly changing energy landscape will have major implications for their workers and communities. Just transitions will require significant, focused investment, committed institutions and deep community engagement. While these processes aren’t likely to be easy, they offer the chance to build sustainable and environmentally friendly economies that can help these states thrive in the future. <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'57',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></p><h2>We’re in a depression, not recession — and the scars will take years to heal (economics) <a href="https://financialpost.com/investing/investing-pro/david-rosenberg-were-in-a-depression-not-recession-and-the-scars-will-take-years-to-heal"> view original </a> <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'58',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></h2><p id= '58' style="display:none"> There is a raging debate as to whether life ever gets back to “normal,” whatever that means.

For example, there is a belief that with a vaccine or not, the citizenry is getting fed up with COVID-19, and everyone is aching to go out to eat and drink and gamble and browse at the malls … and dying to go back to the office. That is the narrative, but it is not the reality.

The polls had already shown how attitudes have been shifting on a secular basis. Even the things that are moving, and moving fast, such as housing sales, are being driven by activity in rural areas and towards single-family units and away from multi-family. There is a much greater appreciation for open space now than there used to be, and that is not going to change in the future.

Neither will working from home, for those who can. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago conducted a survey in the spring and found that three-quarters of companies say the U.S. economy needs at least a year to fully recover from the pandemic. There were 670 respondents in the poll and half told the Chicago Fed that the recovery will take between one and two years to develop. The other half was split between a recovery in less than a year and one that would take more than two years.

Tally up those sectors and they supported 32 million jobs before the crisis, or about a third of the private-sector workforce, and it looks to me as though half of their workers are not going back to their old jobs. I’m not sure many people understand that amusement parks, airlines, hoteliers and restaurants cannot stay in business at 50-per-cent capacity (or even 75 per cent in the case of restaurants).

People have to understand that a cyclically-sensitive consumer-oriented sector, such as restaurants, spends 30 per cent on labour, 30 per cent on rent and 30 per cent on food — they have a 10-per-cent margin. So good luck with a partial reopening and social distancing.

As it stands, the United States Chamber of Commerce said that 25 per cent of small businesses have already shut down. Another survey by Ipsos concluded that two-thirds of people are still nervous about leaving their homes; 59 per cent say they intend to remain locked down on their own until signs emerge that the virus is “fully contained.” A YouGov/CBS poll concluded that 85 per cent of American households say they wouldn’t get on an airplane even if they could — that’s why the industry needs a bailout.

A Washington Post/University of Maryland poll shows that only 56 per cent of consumers across the U.S. intend to shop at the supermarket, which I suppose is a continuous bullish data point for delivery services, but that’s about it. Just 33 per cent say they are comfortable entering a retail store. And a mere 22 per cent say they are willing to dine in a sit-in restaurant.

All these polls say basically the same thing: it will not be “business as usual,” as the bulls will try and convince you, and the best we can hope for is a partial recovery — at best.

What we had on our hands was a vertical economic decline with job losses on an order of magnitude higher than anything witnessed since the Great Depression. Even as the stock market tells you that it has it all figured out, I can assure you that what we face at this very moment is a very uncertain economic future. And, unfortunately, most of the longer-term risks are to the downside.

We are in a depression — not a recession, but a depression. The dynamics of a depression are different than they are in a recession because depressions invoke a secular change in behavior. Classic business cycle recessions are forgotten about within a year after they end. The scars from this one will take years to heal.

Outside of the Treasury market, asset prices still don’t reflect the economic depression because they have been so heavily sedated by unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy stimulus. Beneath that veneer, there is rot.

We shall see how long governments can mask what is really happening organically in the economy. At some point, the well will run dry. Nothing lasts forever, not even what seems for now to be an endless lifeline of government support.

The Guardian is the lead partner of CCN.

Michael Mann, one of the most eminent climate scientists in the world, believes averting climate catastrophe on a global scale would be “essentially impossible” if Donald Trump is re-elected.

A professor at Penn State University, Mann, 54, has published hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific papers, testified numerous times before Congress and appeared frequently in the news media. He is also active on Twitter, where earlier this year he declared: “A second Trump term is game over for the climate – really!”, a statement he reaffirmed in an interview with the Guardian and Covering Climate Now.

None of Mann’s 200-plus scientific papers is more famous than the so-called “hockey stick study”, which Nature published on Earth Day of 1998. With two co-authors, Mann demonstrated that global temperature had been trending downward for the previous one thousand years. Graphed, this line was the long handle of the hockey stick, which surged abruptly upwards in about 1950 – represented by the blade of the stick – to make the 1990s the warmest decade in “at least the last millennium”.

In 1999, Mann became an assistant professor at the University of Virginia, where he was targeted by the climate denier crowd, an experience detailed in his 2012 book The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars. He received death threats, he says, and had emails stolen. Virginia’s former attorney general Ken Cuccinelli, a hard-right Republican, subpoenaed documents related to Mann’s research funding in an effort to prove fraud. A Washington Post editorial blasted Cuccinelli for “mis[using] state funds in his own personal war against climate science”. In 2014, affirming a lower court’s decision, the supreme court of Virginia ruled against Cuccinelli, who now serves as a top official in Trump’s Department of Homeland Security.

Mann denies that it’s a partisan statement to say that four more years of Trump would mean “game over” for the climate.

It’s also a scientific statement, Mann adds. Two years ago this month, scientists with the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published a landmark study, Global Warming of 1.5 Degrees, which found that humanity had to cut heat-trapping emissions roughly by half by 2030 to avoid catastrophic climate breakdown. Headlines warned we had “12 years to save the planet”. Those 12 years are now 10.

The numbers get unrealistically challenging if Trump gains another four years as president.

Fortunately, there is encouraging news about climate science as well. It was long thought that Earth’s climate system carried a substantial lag effect, mainly because carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere, trapping heat, for many decades after being emitted. Even if all CO2 emissions were halted overnight, global temperatures would keep rising and heatwaves, droughts, storms and other impacts would keep intensifying “for about 25 to 30 years”, Sir David King, the former chief science advisor to the British government, said in 2006.

Mann says research over the last decade has overturned this interpretation.

Using new, more elaborate computer models equipped with an interactive carbon cycle, “what we now understand is that if you stop emitting carbon right now … the oceans start to take up carbon more rapidly,” Mann says. Such ocean storage of CO2 “mostly” offsets the warming effect of the CO2 that still remains in the atmosphere. Thus, the actual lag between halting CO2 emissions and halting temperature rise is not 25 to 30 years, he explains, but “more like three to five years”.

This is “a dramatic change in our understanding” of the climate system that gives humans “more agency”, says Mann. Rather than being locked into decades of inexorably rising temperatures, humans can turn down the heat almost immediately by slashing emissions promptly. “Our destiny is determined by our behavior,” says Mann, a fact he finds “empowering”.

In the face of this urgency, Mann broadly supports implementing a Green New Deal. This he defines as a vast government effort that deploys both regulations – for example, no more coal plants – and market mechanisms like carbon pricing to transition away from fossil fuels as rapidly as possible. In the coming weeks, he adds, there is no more important way for US citizens to exercise agency than to vote – vote for candidates who support such a transition, such as Joe Biden, and against Donald Trump and other Republicans who obstruct it.

In an extension of Barack Obama’s 2008 transition plan, which banned registered lobbyists from contributing to the transition or working in areas on which they lobbied in the last year, the Biden plan bans anyone who registered as a lobbyist or foreign agent in the last year from serving unless they receive approval by the general counsel.

Biden transition team members are also prohibited from lobbying any agencies with which they have “substantial responsibility” or working for foreign entities both during the transition and in the 12 months after, and they are barred from accepting gifts that even appear to be aimed at influencing their decisions.

Transition team members are prohibited from trading stocks during the transition, a decision that comes just months after four senators were investigated by the Justice Department for stock trades shortly before the coronavirus pandemic, with Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) still under investigation.

Forbes has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment.

Despite campaigning to “drain the swamp,” Trump’s 2016 transition was initially packed with lobbyists for everyone from Verizon to oil giants to major food corporations. Even after instituting a lobbying ban, the transition team was still found to be packed with them. Many members also went on to become lobbyists shortly after the transition despite a ban on doing so. The administration has also been rocked by several scandals involving transition members who failed to register as foreign agents.

226. That’s how many Trump administration officials served as lobbyists before working in the federal government or became lobbyists after their service, according to Open Secrets, despite Trump signing an executive order early in his term banning lobbying after 5 years of working in the administration.

“Our ethics code and plan demonstrate the values that would be part of a Biden-Harris Administration and promote accountability to garner trust from the American people at every stage,” said transition co-chair Ted Kaufman, a former Delaware Senator and close adviser to Biden.

The plan puts significant decision-making power in the hands of the transition team’s general counsel, Jessica Hertz, who, after serving in various roles in the Obama Justice Department, most recently worked as a general counsel for Facebook.

Though the rules only apply for the transition, the transition team hinted they will serve as a model for a Biden administration. “As with previous administrations, and consistent with his commitment to build an administration that serves the people, not private interests, if elected, Vice President Biden will require his appointees to be governed by an administration ethics pledge,” the transition team said in a statement.

The measure, originally due to start in April, makes it illegal for businesses to sell or supply the items.

People in England use an estimated 4.7 billion plastic straws, 316 million plastic stirrers and 1.8 billion plastic-stemmed cotton buds each year.

Environmental campaigners welcomed the ban but called for a crackdown on further single-use items.

An exemption will allow hospitals, bars and restaurants to provide plastic straws to people with disabilities or medical conditions that require them.

Environment Secretary George Eustice said the government was "firmly committed" to tackling environmental "devastation" caused by single-use plastics.

Campaigners welcomed the move but said the items formed only a "fraction" of the plastic waste littering the environment.

Sion Elis Williams, of Friends of the Earth, said ministers "must also do more to challenge our throwaway culture by forcing a shift away from all single-use materials in favour of reusable alternatives".

But they remained "a tiny fraction" of single-use plastics, she said, adding that countries such as Ireland and France had "shown far more ambition" with targets on reusable packaging and deposit return schemes.

Mr Eustice said the government was "building plans" for a deposit return scheme to encourage recycling of single-use drinks containers.

The Welsh government has said it is also considering a similar ban on plastics.

A number of national restaurant chains ditched plastic straws before the ban was announced. <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'62',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></p><h2>Former reality TV host tests positive for COVID-19 (entertainment) <a href="https://news.avclub.com/former-reality-tv-host-tests-positive-for-covid-19-1845248943?"> view original </a> <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'64',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></h2><p id= '64' style="display:none"> The Trumps’ diagnosis comes hours after it was announced that senior aide Hope Hicks had developed symptoms Wednesday and tested positive for the virus, and just two days after Trump spent an hour-and-a-half interrupting Joe Biden and Chris Wallace at the first of three scheduled presidential debates—the second and third of which are now a question mark. “The presidential race has been fundamentally altered tonight, there should be no more in-person gatherings,” Dr. Vin Gupta told NBC News’ Brian Williams while discussing Trump’s diagnosis, adding to the chorus of talking heads assuming that the remaining debates will be canceled.

Moore, a noted Trump critic and supporter of rival and former Vice President Joe Biden, put forth the theory in a lengthy Facebook post.

Moore referenced World War II Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet and Spanish dictator Francisco Franco in his diatribe. In addition, he derided former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms.

He correctly predicted in July 2016 that Trump would "likely" beat Hillary Clinton. <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'67',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></p><h2>Colbert: Trump’s Refusal to Condemn Proud Boys ‘One of the Most Upsetting Moments’ of His Life (entertainment) <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/colbert-drags-trump-for-refusing-to-condemn-proud-boys-one-of-the-most-upsetting-moments-of-his-life?ref=wrap"> view original </a> <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'68',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></h2><p id= '68' style="display:none"> “Get ready for democracy to crumble!!!” Stephen Colbert shouted at the top of his live post-debate monologue Tuesday night.

The measure -- which takes effect on January 1st -- was triggered by the aftermath of the Kobe Bryant helicopter crash ... when 8 local deputies were accused of taking or sharing death pics for unofficial business.

In fact, at least one deputy was accused of using a Kobe death photo to try and pick up a woman at a bar.

But, on Monday, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the bill which will make it a misdemeanor for a first responder to take or share pics from an accident or crime scene for any purpose outside official law enforcement or genuine public interest.

Kobe's widow, Vanessa Bryant, has already filed a lawsuit against the L.A. County Sheriff's Office over the alleged accident photo scandal. She's suing for negligence, invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

Kobe, along with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and 7 other people, was killed in the January 26 incident when their chopper crashed in Calabasas on an extremely foggy day.

An accompanying video, voiced by Sacha Baron Cohen’s Borat, offers a preview of the new film – released on Amazon on 23 October, two weeks before the election. Statements by Borat about Trump’s competence and supremacy play over apparently contradictory news footage.

Other aspects of Trump’s track record up for discussion appear to be his treatment of women, his military record, his health (“Never had stroke,” says Borat, over clips of Trump struggling with stairs or a bottle of water) and his handling of the Covid pandemic.

During the debate, the account also “fact-checked” Joe Biden’s claims for the efficacy of face coverings in stopping the spread of coronavirus, saying that the “urine therapy” pioneered by Trump was the “only proven facial protection”.

Overnight, Baron Cohen also tweeted a film poster featuring Borat using a face mask as a mankini on what appears to be a nod to the infamous garment worn to promote the first film in Cannes.

A trailer, released later on Thursday, shows Borat returning to America with the intention of “gifting” his teenage daughter to an American. <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'70',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></p><h2>Chrissy Teigen and John Legend Lose Third Child (entertainment) <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2020/09/30/chrissy-teigen-john-legend-son-jack-dies/"> view original </a> <a href="###" onclick="openShutManager(this,'73',false,' <<< >>> ',' <<< >>> ')" style='float:right'> <<< >>> </a></h2><p id= '73' style="display:none"> Chrissy Teigen and John Legend just suffered an unimaginable loss ... their son has died.
